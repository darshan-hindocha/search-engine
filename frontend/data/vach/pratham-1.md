On the night of Mãgshar sudi 4, Samvat 1876 [21 November  1819], Shriji Mahãrãj had come to the residential hall of the sãdhus in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã. He was dressed entirely in  white clothes. At that time, an assembly of sãdhus as well as  devotees from various places had gathered before Him.

Thereupon Shriji Mahãrãj asked, “Which is the most difficult of  all spiritual endeavours?”

The brahmachãris, sãdhus and householders answered according to their own understanding, but none could give a satisfactory reply.

Shriji Mahãrãj then said, “Allow Me to answer. There is no  spiritual endeavour more difficult than to continuously engage one’s  mind on the form of God. The scriptures state that there is no greater attainment for a person whose mind’s vrutti is constantly  focused on the form of God, because the form of God is like a chintãmani. Just as a person who possesses a chintãmani attains  whatever he desires, a person whose mind’s vrutti is constantly  focused on the form of God can instantly see, if he so wishes, the  forms of jiva, ishwar, mãyã and Brahma. He can also see Vaikunth,  Golok, Brahmamahol and the other abodes of God. Therefore, there  is no spiritual endeavour more difficult nor is there any greater  attainment than to continuously engage one’s mind on the form of  God.”

Thereafter, the devotee Govardhanbhãi Sheth asked Shriji Mahãrãj, “What is the nature of God’s mãyã?”

Shriji Mahãrãj replied, “Mãyã is anything that obstructs a devotee of God while meditating on God’s form.”

Then Muktãnand Swãmi inquired, “What type of body does a  devotee of God attain when he leaves his physical body, which is  composed of the five bhuts, and goes to the abode of God?”

Shriji Mahãrãj answered, “A devotee who has sought refuge in  Dharmakul will attain, by the wish of God, a divine body composed of  Brahma. When such devotees leave their body and go to the abode of  God, some go by sitting on Garud, some go by sitting on a chariot and  some go by sitting on a celestial vehicle. This is how they reach the  abode of God. Those who have mastered yogic samãdhi can actually  witness these events.”

Thereafter, the devotee Harji Thakkar asked Shriji Mahãrãj,  “Some have been practising satsang for quite some time,yet they do  not harbour the same profound love for the Satsang fellowship as  they do for their own body and relatives. What is the reason for  this?”

Shriji Mahãrãj explained, “Such a person has not fully realised  the greatness of God. Consequently, when the Sant – by whose  association God’s greatness is fully realised – talks to him about his  swabhãvs, the person is not able to overcome them. Instead, he bears  an aversion towards the Sant. It is due to this sin that he does not  develop intense love for the Satsang fellowship. After all, sins committed elsewhere are washed away through association with the  Sant, but sins committed against the Sant are washed away only by  the grace of the Sant himself, not by any other means. The scriptures also state: Anya-kshetre krutam pãpam teertha-kshetre vinashyati | Teertha-kshetre krutam pãpam vajra-lepo bhavishyati || Sins committed elsewhere are destroyed at a place of pilgrimage; [but] sins  committed at a place of pilgrimage are as if etched in iron [i.e. totally irredeemable].  Skand PurãnTherefore, if one does not bear an aversion towards the Sant, one  develops profound love for the Satsang fellowship.”
