On Posh sudi 5, Samvat 1876 [21 December 1819], Shriji Mahãrãj was sitting on a large, decorated cot on the verandaoutside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã. He had tied a white feto around His head and waswearing a white angarkhu and a white survãl. He had also tied a deep orange shelu around His  waist. At that time, paramhansas as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him.

Out of compassion, Shriji Mahãrãj then began to speak to the  paramhansas, “The Vãsudev Mãhãtmya scripture is extremely dear  to Me because it describes all of the methods of how devotees of God  should worship Him.”

Shriji Mahãrãj then continued, “There are two types of devotees of God: One has a complete conviction of God, yet worships God identifying himself with the body. The other, however, believes his  own self to be chaitanya, transcending the influences of the three  states – waking, dream and deep sleep, and the three bodies – sthul,  sukshma and kãran. This devotee worships God while beholding  God’s form within his own self. As a result, he sees his own self,  which transcends the three states and the three bodies, as being  extremely full of divine light. Within that light, he sees the form of  God, just as it is in its incarnate form, as being extremely luminous.  Such is the elevated spiritual state of the latter devotee.

“As long as one has not attained this elevated spiritual state, one  is subject to obstacles, even if one is a devotee of God. Shivji, for  example, did not behave in such an elevated spiritual state and was  therefore enticed by the beauty of Mohini. Brahmã also did not  behave in such a state and thus became infatuated on seeing Saraswati. Nãradji also did not behave in such an elevated spiritual  state and consequently harboured a desire to marry. Moreover, because Indra, Chandra and others were not behaving in such a state, their reputations were also blemished due to their mistakes.

“Furthermore, if a person has not developed this elevated spiritual state, he will perceive worldly attributes even in God, even if  he himself is a devotee of God. King Parikshit, for example, was not  such a devotee, and so he raised doubts about the divinity of Shri  Krishna Bhagwãn after hearing of the rãs episode. On the other  hand, because Shukji was such an elevated devotee, he had no doubts  whatsoever. Such a devotee firmly realises, ‘If no flaws can affect me  or bind me in any way, how can there possibly be any mãyik flaws in  God, by whose worship I have become like this?’ Such a devotee  firmly realises this.

“When such a devotee of God focuses his vrutti on the form of  God, that vrutti is divided into two. Of these, one vrutti focuses on  the form of God, while the other focuses within the worshipper himself. The vrutti that is fixed on God’s form is applied lovingly,  whereas the vrutti that is fixed on the worshipper himself is full of  contemplation. This latter vrutti negates all other thoughts and desires – except those of worshipping God – that may arise in the  worshipper. It also negates all of the flaws within the worshipper  himself. In this manner, the vrutti of such a devotee constantly  remains on God.

“A person who at times worships God with a concentrated mind  and, at other times, indulges in worldly thoughts does not develop  such an elevated spiritual state. Consider, for example, a pot that is  filled with water and emptied somewhere. If another pot of water is  subsequently emptied at the same place on the following day or the  day after that, a pool of water will not collect there. Why? Because  the water poured on the first day dries up on that very day, and the  water poured on the second day also dries up on that same day. On  the other hand, if a trickle of water were to flow continuously, a large  pool of water would soon be formed. Therefore, while eating, drinking, walking, engaging in any activity whatsoever – whether it  be pure or impure – in fact, at all times, one should constantly keep  one’s vrutti on God. While maintaining one’s vrutti constantly on  God in this manner, one attains that abiding elevated spiritual state.”
