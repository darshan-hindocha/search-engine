On the evening of Posh sudi Punam, Samvat 1876 [31 December  1819], Shriji Mahãrãj was sitting on a large, decorated coton the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã. He was wearing a white khes and hadcovered Himself with a thick, white cotton cloth. He had also tied a white pãgh around His head. He was wearing garlandsof white flowers, and tassels of white flowers were dangling from His pãgh. At that time, an assembly of sãdhus as wellas devotees from various places had gathered before Him.

Shriji Mahãrãj then said, “Please ask a question.”

Thereupon Gopãlãnand Swãmi asked, “How can the force of bhakti coupled with dharma, gnãn and vairãgya be intensified?”

Shriji Mahãrãj replied, “There are four means to accomplish  this: One is a pure place, the second is an auspicious time, the third  is pious actions, and the fourth is the company of a holy person1. Of  these, the influence of actions is slight, whereas the influences of  place, time and company are more powerful. Why? Because, if a  place is pure, and the time is pure and one also keeps the company of  a sãdhu like yourself, then actions will naturally be pure as well.  Conversely, if a place is impure – like the region of Sindh, if the time  is impure, and if one also keeps the company of prostitutes and perverted people, or of those who consume alcohol and meat, then  actions will certainly be impure as well. Therefore, one should stay  where there is a pure place and should abandon – by whatever means  necessary – a place where the time has become unfavourable. One  should keep the company of devotees of God as well as the company of  the Sant who is a knower of Brahma and who observes the five religious vows4. As a result, a devotee’s bhakti for God gains tremendous vigour. This is the answer to your question.”

Thereafter Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, initially a devotee may be very impure at heart, but he later becomes extremely  pure. Is this due to his previous sanskãrs, the grace of God or the  devotee’s personal endeavours?”

Shriji Mahãrãj explained, “The good or bad that occurs due to  one’s previous sanskãrs is apparent to everyone in the world. For  instance, the case of Bharatji becoming attached to a deer can be  understood to be due to prãrabdha. Or if a poor person were to  receive a large kingdom, then everyone would come to know of it.  That should be known as prãrabdha.”

Then, narrating His own story, Shriji Mahãrãj continued, “Now,  considering the spiritual endeavours I had performed, it is inconceivable that My body should survive such austerities, yet even  in those circumstances it did survive. That can be considered to be  due to prãrabdha. What were those circumstances? Well, while  staying in Purushottampuri, I spent many months surviving merely  on air. On one occasion, I allowed My body to be carried away by a  river that was three to four gãus wide. During the winter, summer  and monsoon, I stayed without any shelter whatsoever, wearing only  a loincloth. I also used to wander in the jungle amongst wild animals  such as tigers, elephants and wild buffaloes. I travelled in countless  such arduous conditions, yet My body did not perish. In these situations, one should consider prãrabdha to be responsible.

“Now consider the son of the Brãhmin named Sãndipani who  was saved from narak and also five-year-old Dhruvji,to whom the  meanings of the Vedas and other scriptures were spontaneously revealed when he began to utter the praises of God. In these situations, as well as when one’s mind is purified by the wish of God,  or by His grace, or by the grace of His Ekãntik Sant who has been  pleased by one’s extremely pure sentiments – the influence of God’s  grace should be considered to be responsible.

“If one keeps the company of a pious sãdhu and becomes virtuous through one’s own thoughts, then that is known as  ‘personal  endeavour’.”

Having said this, Shriji Mahãrãj bid ‘Jai Sachchidãnand’ to the  assembly and returned to His seat laughing.
