On Mãgshar sudi 13, Samvat 1876 [29 November 1819], Shriji  Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã. He was  dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an assembly of paramhansas as well as devotees from various places had gathered  before Him.

Thereupon Shriji Mahãrãj said, “Once, when I was travelling  from Venkatãdri to Setubandh Rãmeshwar, I encountered a sãdhu by  the name of Sevakrãm. He had studied the Shrimad Bhãgwat and  the other Purãns. But it so happened that during his journey, he fell  ill. He had a thousand rupees worth of gold coins with him, but since  he had no one to nurse him, he began to cry. I consoled him, saying,  ‘Do not worry about anything; I shall serve you.’

“On the outskirts of the village was a banana grove which had a  banyan tree within which a thousand ghosts lived. Because that  sãdhu had become extremely ill and was unable to walk any further,  I felt extreme pity for him. I prepared a bed of banana leaves one and-a-half feet high under that banyan tree. As the sãdhu was  suffering from dysentery and was passing blood, I would wash him  and attend to him.

“The sãdhu would give Me enough of his money to buy sugar,  sãkar, ghee and grains for himself. I would bring the ingredients,  cook them, and then feed him. As for Myself, I would go to the village for My meals. On some days, when I did not receive any food  from the village, I had to fast. Despite this, that sãdhu never once  said to Me, ‘I have enough money. Cook for both of us so that You  may dine with me.’

“After serving the sãdhu for two months in this way, he began to  recover. Thereafter, as we walked towards Setubandh Rãmeshwar,  he made Me carry his belongings weighing about 20 kgs, whereas he  would walk with only a rosary in his hand. By then, he was healthy  and capable of digesting half a kilogram of ghee, yet he would make  Me carry his load while he walked empty-handed. In actual fact, My  nature was such that I would not keep even a handkerchief with Me.  But respecting him as a sãdhu, I walked carrying his belongings  weighing 20 kgs.

“Although I served that sãdhu and helped him recover, he did  not offer Me even a single paisa worth of food. Therefore, realising  him to be ungrateful, I abandoned his company. In this way, a person who does not appreciate favours done by others should be known as an ungrateful person.

“In addition, if a person has committed a sin but has also performed the prescribed atonement for it as laid down in the scriptures, then whoever still considers him a sinner should himself  be known as a sinner just like an ungrateful person.”
