On Mãgshar vadi 3, Samvat 1876 [4 December 1819], Shriji  Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.He was  dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an assembly of all of  the sãdhus as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him.

Thereupon Shriji Mahãrãj said, “A person whose heart is filled  with bhakti towards God feels, ‘I want to act only according to God’s  and His Sant’s commands.’ Such is the spirit within his heart.  Moreover, he never – even by mistake – utters, ‘I will only be able to  follow certain commands, but not others.’

“Furthermore, such a person remains determined to behold God’s form in his heart. If, while meditating on that form, it cannot  be beheld, he does not lose courage. Instead, he constantly maintains  renewed shraddhã. While trying to behold that form, disturbing  thoughts may arise, and, despite his efforts, they may not be suppressed. In this situation, by understanding the immense glory of  God and believing himself to be completely fulfilled, such a person  persists in overcoming those disturbing thoughts and beholding God’s  form within his heart. Even if this process takes 10 years, 20 years,  25 years, or even 100 years, he still does not become discouraged; and  never does he abandon his attempts at beholding God’s form. After  all, Shri Krishna Bhagwãn has mentioned in the Gitã:Therefore, one who continues to behold God in this manner is called  an ekãntik bhakta.”
