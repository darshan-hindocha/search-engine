On Mãgshar sudi 9, Samvat 1876 [26 November 1819], Shriji  Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã. He was  dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an assembly of munis as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him.

Thereupon Shriji Mahãrãj said, “In this Satsang fellowship, a  person who is wise increasingly finds flaws within himself and perceives virtues in God and His devotees. Moreover, when God and  His Sant utter harsh words of advice for his own benefit, he accepts  them as beneficial and is not hurt by them. Such a person steadily  attains greatness in Satsang.

“Conversely, as a person who lacks wisdom practises satsang and listens to discourses in Satsang, he continually perceives virtues  within himself. Moreover, when God and His Sant highlight his  flaws and advise him, he misinterprets such advice due to his arrogance. On the contrary, he perceives flaws in God and His Sant.  Such a person steadily declines and loses his reputation in Satsang.  Therefore, if a person renounces the vanity of his own virtues, becomes brave, and keeps faith in God and His Sant, then his  ignorance is eradicated and he attains greatness in Satsang.”
