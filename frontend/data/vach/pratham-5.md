On Mãgshar sudi 8, Samvat 1876 [25 November 1819], Shriji  Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã. He was  dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an assembly of paramhansas as well as devotees from various places had gathered  before Him.

Thereupon Shriji Mahãrãj said, “One should meditate on Shri  Krishna Bhagwãn together with Rãdhikã. If during that meditation one cannot behold the form within one’s heart, one should not lose  faith and stop the meditation. Those who persist in this way will  earn the immense grace of God. Moreover, God will be bound by  their bhakti.”
