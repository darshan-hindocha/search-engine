On the night of Mãgshar sudi 5, Samvat 1876 [22 November  1819], Shriji Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in  Gadhadã. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an  assembly of sãdhus as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him.

Thereupon Mayãrãm Bhatt asked Shriji Mahãrãj, “Mahãrãj,  please describe the characteristics of the highest, intermediate and  lowest levels of vairãgya?”

Shriji Mahãrãj explained, “A person who has the highest level of  vairãgya engages in worldly activities, either by God’s command or  as a consequence of his prãrabdha karmas. But, like King Janak, he  is not affected by those activities. He may indulge in the most  alluring of the panchvishays – sights, sounds, smells, tastes and touch – attained as a consequence of his own prãrabdha, but he does  so dejectedly and with total indifference towards them. Those vishays are unable to entice him; thus, his renunciation remains  undiminished. He invariably views those vishays as flawed and treats them like enemies. Moreover, he constantly remains in contact with sãdhus and the sacred scriptures, and remains in the  service of God. Even if he were to encounter adverse places, times,  company, etc.1, his understanding would not diminish. Such a person is said to possess the highest level of vairãgya.

"A person who has an intermediate level of vairãgya also indulges in the best of the panchvishays and remains unattracted to  them. But, if he were to encounter adverse places, times, company,  etc., he would become attached to those vishays. Consequently, his  level of vairãgya would diminish. Such a person is said to possess an  intermediate level of vairãgya.

“As for a person who has the lowest level of vairãgya, if he were  to encounter ordinary or inferior vishays,he may indulge in them,  but he would not become bound by them. However, if he were to  encounter and indulge in appealing vishays, he would become bound  by them. Such a person is said to possess the lowest level of vairãgya.”
