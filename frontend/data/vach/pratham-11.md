On Mãgshar sudi 14, Samvat 1876 [30 November 1819], Shriji  Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã. He was  dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an assembly of munis as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him.

Thereupon Brahmãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, what is the  nature of ‘vãsanã’?”

Shriji Mahãrãj explained, “A desire within the antahkaran to  enjoy vishays that have been previously seen, heard or indulged in is  called ‘vãsanã’. Moreover, a desire within the antahkaran to enjoy  those vishays that have not been previously indulged in is also called  ‘vãsanã’.”

Thereafter Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, who can be called an ekãntik bhakta of God?”

Shriji Mahãrãj replied, “A person who has no ‘vãsanã’ except  that of God and who offers bhakti to God realising himself to be brahmarup is called an ekãntik bhakta.”
