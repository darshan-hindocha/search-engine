On Mãgshar vadi 4, Samvat 1876 [5 December 1819], Shriji  Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.He was  dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an assembly of sãdhus as well as devotees from various places had gathered before  Him.

Thereupon Shriji Mahãrãj said, “A wise devotee of God who can  discern between sat and asat identifies the flaws within himself and  thoughtfully eradicates them. He also rejects any apparent flaws he  perceives in the Sant or a satsangi and imbibes only their virtues.  Moreover, he never perceives any faults whatsoever in God. In addition, he accepts whatever words of advice God and the Sant offer  as the highest truth but does not doubt their words in any way.  Thus, when the Sant tells him, ‘You are distinct from the mind,  body, indriyas and prãns; you are satya; you are the knower of the  body, indriyas and prãns, which are all asatya’ – he accepts this to be  the truth. He then behaves as the ãtmã – distinct from them all – but never follows the instincts of his own mind.

“Furthermore, such a person identifies those objects and evil  company that may cause bondage or raise deficiencies in his ekãntik  dharma and shuns them; but he does not become bound by them.  Also, he imbibes positive thoughts and avoids negative thoughts. One who behaves in this manner should be known to possess wisdom.”
