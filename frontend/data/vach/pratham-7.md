On Mãgshar sudi 10, Samvat 1876 [26 November 1819], Shriji  Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã. He was  dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an assembly of sãdhus as well as devotees from various places had gathered before  Him.

Thereupon Shriji Mahãrãj said, “No one is able to understand  the philosophical principles found in the scriptures; in fact, all are  confused by them. Therefore, please listen as I explain those principles precisely as they are.

“Behaving as if united with the three bodies of sthul, sukshma and kãran is the anvay form of the jiva. The jiva as distinct from  these three bodies and characterised by eternal existence is its vyatirek form.

“Ishwar when together with its three bodies of virãt, sutrãtmã and avyãkrut is its anvay form. Ishwar as distinct from those three  bodies, and characterised by eternal existence, is its vyatirek form.

“When Aksharbrahma pervades mãyã and the entities evolved  from mãyã – the countless millions of brahmãnds – it is said to be in  its anvay form. When it is distinct from everything and has the  attributes of eternal existence, consciousness and bliss, that is said to  be its vyatirek form.

“When Shri Krishna Bhagwãn is the antaryãmi of and the controller of Aksharbrahma, the ishwars, the jivas, mãyã and the  entities evolved from mãyã – the brahmãnds – that is said to be the  anvay form of God. When He is distinct from all and resides amidst  the light of Brahma in His abode, Golok, that is said to be the vyatirek form of God.

“These five entities – Parabrahma, Aksharbrahma, mãyã, the  ishwars and the jivas – are eternal.”
