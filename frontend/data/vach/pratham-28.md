On Posh sudi 14, Samvat 1876 [30 December 1819], Shriji Mahãrãj was sitting on a large, decorated cot on the veranda outside  the room in line with the room of Shri Vãsudevnãrãyan in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, the sãdhus had sat down to eat in His  presence.

Thereupon Shriji Mahãrãj said, “When a satsangi is likely to  regress in the Satsang fellowship, vicious desires steadily flourish  within him. At first, he begins to perceive flaws in all of the satsangis day by day. In his heart, he feels, ‘All of these satsangis lack understanding; only I have true understanding.’ In this way, he  considers himself to be superior to all. Such a person remains constantly uneasy, day and night. He cannot sit peacefully anywhere  during the day; nor can he sleep at night. Moreover, his anger never  subsides. In fact, he constantly smoulders like a half-burnt log. A  person who behaves in this manner should be known to be on the  verge of falling out of Satsang. No matter how many days he spends  in Satsang, he will never experience peace in his heart; ultimately,  he will fall from Satsang.

“Conversely, when a person is likely to progress in Satsang, pure  desires steadily flourish within him. Day by day, he sees only virtues  in all of the satsangis. He views all devotees as superior to himself  and considers himself to be insignificant. Moreover, he experiences  the bliss of Satsang in his heart 24 hours a day. Such characteristics  indicate that pure desires have flourished. In fact, the more such a  person practises satsang, the more he benefits; and eventually, he  attains profound greatness.”

Having delivered this discourse, Shriji Mahãrãj bid ‘Jai Sachchidãnand’ to all and returned to His seat.
