At noon on Posh sudi 4, Samvat 1876 [20 December 1819], Shriji  Mahãrãj was sitting facing east on a large, decorated cot on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in  Gadhadã. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A tassel of flowers had been inserted in His pãgh, and bunches of flowers had  been placed upon both of His ears. He was also wearing a garland of  guldãvadi flowers around His neck. At that time, while some paramhansas were singing devotional songs, other paramhansas as  well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him in an  assembly.

Thereupon Shriji Mahãrãj said, “Please listen; I wish to tell you  something.”

Hearing this, the paramhansas stopped singing and prepared  themselves to listen.

Shriji Mahãrãj then said, “If one does not remember God while  singing to the accompaniment of a mrudang, sãrangi, sarodã, tãl or  other instruments, then that singing is as good as not having sung at  all. Besides, there are many people in this world who sing and play  instruments without remembering God; but they do not attain peace  of mind. Therefore, whichever activity one performs – whether it be  singing devotional songs, reciting God’s holy name, chanting the ‘Nãrãyan’ dhunya, etc. – one should only perform that activity while  remembering the form of God.

“If a person specifically attempts to engage himself in worship,  he may be able to focus his vrutti on God; however, after completing  those acts of worship, if he does not maintain his vrutti on God while  engaged in other activities, then his vrutti will not become steadied  on the form of God even when he attempts to engage in worship again. Therefore, one should practise maintaining one’s vrutti on the  form of God while walking, eating, drinking – in fact, during all    activities. If one does this, one’s vrutti becomes steadied on God  when one engages in worship as well. Moreover, when one’s vrutti begins to remain on God, it remains so even during other work. If  one is complacent, though, one’s vrutti will not remain on God even  when one specifically attempts to engage oneself in worship.  Therefore, a devotee of God should vigilantly practise maintaining his  vrutti on the form of God.”

Having said this, Shriji Mahãrãj requested, “Now please sing  devotional songs.”
