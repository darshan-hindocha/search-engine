On the morning of Posh sudi 7, Samvat 1876 [23 December  1819], Shriji Mahãrãj arrived at the residence of the paramhansas in  Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a thick, white cotton cloth. He had  also tied a white feto around His head. He was sitting facing east on  the western veranda. At that time, paramhansas as well as devotees  from various places had gathered before Him.

Thereupon Shriji Mahãrãj said out of compassion, “A devotee of  God who observes only swadharma does not feel completely fulfilled  within his heart. That feeling of fulfillment can only be attained by  ãtmã-realisation and the knowledge of God’s greatness. Moreover,  the extent of the deficiency in these two attributes determines the  extent of the deficiency in his experience of fulfillment. Therefore, a  devotee of God should firmly cultivate these two qualities.

“Moreover, the extent of the deficiency remaining in these two  factors also determines the extent of the hindrances experienced  during samãdhi. Recently, I granted samãdhi to a devotee in which  she saw intense divine light. Seeing that light, she began to scream;  she shouted, ‘I’m burning!’ Therefore, even those who experience  samãdhi require ãtmã-realisation. If one does not realise one’s own  self to be the ãtmã and instead believes one’s self to be the body,  much deficiency will remain. I explained to that devotee, ‘Your self is  the ãtmã, not the body. You are not this Lãdkibãi of the Bhãt sub caste. Rather, your self is the ãtmã, which is unpierceable and uncuttable.’ I then placed her into samãdhi again and told her, ‘Go  to the four-petalled lotus at the site of Ganapati and behold your own  self there.’

“When a person in samãdhi enters the site of Ganapati, that  person hears divine sounds and sees divine light. When he enters the  higher site of Brahmã, he hears louder sounds and sees brighter  light. When he enters the still higher site of Vishnu, he hears even  louder sounds and sees even brighter light. In this manner, as he  enters higher and higher locations, he hears increasingly louder sounds and sees increasingly brighter light. As a result of the intense divine light seen in samãdhi, and the loud thunderous sounds  that occur, even the most resolute become timid. For example,  despite being a devotee of God and despite being extremely brave,  Arjun was still incapable of beholding God’s Vishwarup form. He  therefore pleaded, ‘O Mahãrãj! I am incapable of beholding this form of yours. Please grant me darshan of your former form.’ Similarly,  in samãdhi, when thundering noises like those of an entire brahmãnd exploding are heard, and masses of intense light like overflowing oceans are seen, even the brave lose their patience.  Therefore, one should understand one’s own self to be distinct from  the body.

“Samãdhi experienced in this manner is achieved in two ways.  One is controlling the prãns through prãnãyãm, whereby the chitt is  also controlled. The other is by controlling the chitt, whereby the  prãns are also controlled. When is control over the chitt achieved? It  is achieved when one’s vruttis are detached from everything else and  focused only on God. However, these vruttis can be focused on God  only when desires for everything else are overcome and only a singular desire for the form of God remains. Thereafter, those vruttis will not be deflected from God’s form by any means whatsoever. For example, if twenty pails of water are drawn from a  well, and the flow of water from each pail allowed to flow in separate  directions, then there would be little force in each flow. However, if  the flow of all twenty pails of water are combined, then the resultant  flow would become extremely powerful – like that of a river – and  would not be able to be diverted by any means whatsoever.  Similarly, when a person’s vruttis have become free of worldly desires, his chitt focuses only on God’s form.

“Conversely, when a person has desires in his chitt for the pleasures of the world, his vrutti is widely dispersed among countless  types of sounds via the ears. Similarly, via the skin, the vrutti is  dispersed among thousands of different types of touch sensations; the  vrutti of the eyes is dispersed among thousands of different types of  things to see; the vrutti of the tongue is dispersed among thousands  of different types of tastes; and the vrutti of the nose is dispersed  among countless types of smells. In the same manner, the vruttis of  his karma-indriyas are dispersed among their respective vishays in thousands of different ways. In this way, via the ten indriyas, his  antahkaran is dispersed in thousands of different ways. Only when  his chitt contemplates on God, and his man generates thoughts of  God, and his buddhi establishes the conviction of God, and his  ahamkãr harbours the consciousness, ‘I am the ãtmã, and a devotee  of God,’ can his desire for God be known to have become singular.

“Alternatively, the control of the chitt by controlling the prãns is  achieved by ashtãng-yoga, which comprises of eight stages: yam, niyam, ãsan, prãnãyãm, pratyãhãr, dhyãn, dhãrnã and samãdhi.  This ashtãng-yoga is a means, and its fruit is the nirvikalp samãdhi of God. When this nirvikalp samãdhi is achieved, the chitt is  controlled by controlling the prãns. On the other hand, if the chitt focuses on God after becoming free of worldly desires, then the prãns are controlled by control of the chitt. Therefore, just as the chitt is  controlled by mastering ashtãng-yoga, similarly, the chitt can also be  controlled by focusing on the form of God. A devotee whose chitt’s  vrutti becomes focused on the form of God masters ashtãng-yoga without even attempting to master it. Therefore, the spiritual endeavours of ãtmã-realisation and the knowledge of God’s greatness  that I have just described should be firmly practised.

“Furthermore, one’s religious vows – which are God’s injunctions – should certainly be observed. For example, the dharma of a Brãhmin is to bathe, lead a pure life and never drink even water  from a Shudra’s house. Similarly, a satsangi should never falter in  observing God’s injunctions. Why? Because God will be pleased with  him if he behaves accordingly.

“Moreover, a person should very firmly maintain both the knowledge of God’s greatness as well as the knowledge of  the ãtmã coupled with vairãgya. He should also feel fulfilled by realising, ‘Now  I have no deficiencies remaining.’ With this understanding, he should constantly offer bhakti to God. Having said this though, he  should not get carried away in the elation of this understanding. Nor  should he feel unfulfilled. If he does feel unfulfilled, then the blessings that have been showered upon him by God can be considered as not having germinated – like a seed sown in saline soil.  Conversely, if he gets carried away and begins to behave waywardly,  then that is like having thrown a seed into a fire, which burns it.  Therefore, if one understands as I have explained, then no form of  deficiency will remain whatsoever.”
