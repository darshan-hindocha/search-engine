On Mãgshar sudi Punam, Samvat 1876 [1 December 1819],  Shriji Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã.  He was dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an assembly  of sãdhus as well as devotees from various places had gathered before  Him.

Shriji Mahãrãj then said, “When one understands the nature of  the causes of the entire creation, specifically Purush, Prakruti, kãl,  the 24 elements2 including mahattattva, etc., then one is released  from the bondage of one’s inherent avidyã and the entities evolved  from it, the 24 elements.”

Thereupon Muktãnand Swãmi asked, “Mahãrãj, how can their  nature be known?”

Shriji Mahãrãj replied, “Their nature can be realised by knowing  their attributes. I shall now describe those attributes.

“Purush is the controller of Prakruti and is also distinct from  her. He is indivisible, without a beginning, without an end, self luminous, omniscient, satya, kshetragna and the cause of the activities of all objects that possess a form. He also has a divine  body.

“Prakruti is composed of the three gunas. She is both jad and  chaitanya, eternal, nirvishesh, the kshetra of all jivas and all elements including mahattattva, and also the divine power of God.

“That which disturbs mãyã – which is nirvishesh and whose  gunas are normally in a state of equilibrium – is known as kãl.

“Now I shall describe the attributes of mahattattva and the  other elements, so please listen.

“Chitt and mahattattva should not be regarded as being different. The entire world inherently resides in a subtle  form within  mahattattva, which itself is unchanging, luminous, pure, passive and full of pure sattvagun.

“Now I shall describe the attributes of ahamkãr. Ahamkãr is  composed of the three gunas, and is the cause of the evolution of all of  the bhuts, indriyas, antahkarans, their presiding deities, and the  prãns. It is passive, dense, and totally ignorant.

“I shall now describe the attributes of the man. The man is the  site where all desires for women and other objects are generated. It  is subject to fluctuating thoughts and is the governor of all of the  indriyas.

“Now I shall describe the attributes of buddhi. It possesses the  knowledge of all objects. The specific knowledge which all of the  indriyas possess is also due to the buddhi. Its inherent features are  doubts, conviction, sleep and memory.

“The attribute of the ten indriyas – the ears, the skin, the eyes,  the tongue, the nose, the voice, the hands, the feet, the anus, and the  genitals – is to engage themselves in their respective vishays.

“Now I shall describe the attributes of the five tanmãtrãs. The  attributes of sound are that it is the indicator of all objects, and the  cause of all social interactions. Sound also reveals the nature and  class of the speaker. It dwells within ãkãsh and is also the tanmãtrã of ãkãsh. It is perceived by the ears. These are the attributes of  sound.

“I shall now describe the attributes of touch. It is the tanmãtrã of vãyu. Softness, hardness, coldness, hotness and perception by the  skin are the attributes of touch.

“Now I shall describe the attributes of sight. It reveals the forms of all objects. It resides subordinately in all objects, and changes as objects change. It is the tanmãtrã of tej and is perceived  by the eyes.

“Now I shall describe the attributes of taste. Sweetness, pungency, distastefulness, bitterness, sourness and saltiness are its  attributes. It is the tanmãtrã of jal and is perceived by the tongue.

“I shall now describe the attributes of smell. Fragrance and  stench are its attributes. It is the tanmãtrã of pruthvi and is  perceived by the nose.

“Now I shall describe the attributes of pruthvi. It supports all  jivas and, in the form of a celestial body, is their place of residence.  It separates the other four bhuts, i.e. ãkãsh, etc., and it gives a physical form to all life forms. These are the attributes of pruthvi.

“I shall now describe the attributes of jal. It binds pruthvi and  other substances, and it also softens and moistens all objects. It  satisfies and sustains all life forms. Quenching thirst, subduing heat  and abundance are also the attributes of jal.

“Now I shall describe the attributes of tej. Luminance, causing  the digestion of food, absorbing liquids, eliminating cold, drying, creating hunger and thirst, as well as burning wood, ghee and other  sacrificial offerings are the attributes of tej.

“I shall now describe the attributes of vãyu. Vãyu causes trees  to shake, and it gathers leaves and other objects. It also carries the  panchvishays, i.e., sights, sounds, smells, tastes and touch, to their  respective indriyas, i.e. eyes, ears, etc. It is the vital force of all of the  indriyas.

“Finally, I shall describe the attributes of ãkãsh. It provides  space for all jivas, and is the cause of the internal and external  activities of their bodies. It is also where the prãns, indriyas and  antahkarans reside. These are the attributes of ãkãsh.

"In this manner, by knowing the attributes of the 24 elements2,  Prakruti, Purush and kãl, one is freed from ignorance.

“Moreover, one should know the process of creation of all of these, which I shall now describe.

“While residing in His abode, Shri Krishna Bhagwãn  impregnates the womb of mãyã through Akshar-Purush, through  whom countless millions of Pradhãns and Purushes are produced.  What are those Pradhãn-Purush pairs like? Well, they are the cause  of the creation of countless millions of brahmãnds. Of these, I shall  now tell you about one Pradhãn-Purush pair – the cause of the creation of one brahmãnd.

“Firstly, Purushottam Shri Krishna Bhagwãn, in the form of  Purush, impregnated the womb of Pradhãn. From that Pradhãn,  mahattattva evolved. From mahattattva, the three types of ahamkãr evolved. Of these, from sãttvik-ahamkãr, the man and the presiding  deities of the indriyas evolved; from rãjas-ahamkãr, the ten indriyas,  the buddhi and the prãns evolved; and from tãmas-ahamkãr, the five  bhuts and the five tanmãtrãs evolved. In this way, all of those elements were produced.

“Then, inspired by God’s will, each element, with its own constituents, helped create the bodies of the ishwars and the jivas. A  particular ishwar’s bodies are known as virãt, sutrãtmã and avyãkrut; and a particular jiva’s bodies are known as sthul, sukshma and kãran.

“The body of the ishwar called Virãt has a lifespan of two parãrdhs. Fourteen manvantars elapse during one of Virãt-Purush’s  days. His night is of the same duration as the day. During his day,  the lower ten realms of the brahmãnd remain in existence, and after  his night falls, they are destroyed. This is called nimitta-pralay.  When the two parãrdhs of Virãt-Purush have elapsed, the body of  Virãt is destroyed along with Satyalok and the other realms. At that  time, Pradhãn-Prakruti, Purush, and the 24 elements2 including mahattattva are absorbed back into mahãmãyã. This is called prãkrut-pralay. When that mahãmãyã is absorbed by the divine  light of Aksharbrahma – like the night merges into the day – it is  called ãtyantik-pralay. Also, the day-to-day death of the bodies of  individual deities, demons, humans and others is called nitya-pralay.

“In this manner, by knowing the process of the creation, sustenance and dissolution of the various realms, one develops  vairãgya towards the world and bhakti towards God. In addition,  when all of those brahmãnds are destroyed, all other jivas lie dormant within mãyã, whereas the devotees of God attain the abode  of God.”

Again, Muktãnand Swãmi inquired, “What is the abode of God  like?”

Shriji Mahãrãj replied, “The abode of God is without a beginning  and without an end; it is divine, infinite and indivisible; and it is  characterised by eternal existence, consciousness and bliss. I shall  describe it using an analogy. Imagine that this whole world, with all  of its mountains, trees, humans, animals and all other forms, is  made of glass. Also imagine that all of the stars in the sky are as  bright as the sun. Then, just as this glass world would glow with  extreme beauty amidst this radiance, the abode of God is similarly  beautiful. Devotees of God see this in samãdhi and attain that  luminous abode after death.”
