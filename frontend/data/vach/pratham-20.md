On Posh sudi 2, Samvat 1876 [18 December 1819], Shriji Mahãrãj was seated on a cushion with a cylindrical pillow on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in  Gadhadã. He had tied a white pãgh around His head, and a tassel of  yellow flowers had been placed in that pãgh. A garland of yellow  flowers had been placed around His neck, and bunches of white and  yellow flowers had been placed upon His ears. He had also covered  Himself with a thick, white cotton cloth and was wearing a black bordered khes. At that time, scriptural reading had commenced, and  paramhansas as well as devotees from various places had gathered  before Shriji Mahãrãj.

Then Swãmi Shri Sahajãnandji Mahãrãj said, “Please listen, I  wish to ask all of you a question.”

Hearing this, all of the devotees said with folded hands, “Please  do ask.”

Thereupon Shriji Mahãrãj asked, “Who is the most ignorant of  all ignorant people?”

Everyone pondered over the question, but no one was able to reply. So Shriji Mahãrãj said, “Here, I shall answer Myself.”

Hearing this, everyone was pleased and said, “Mahãrãj, only You  will be able to give a precise answer; so please explain.”

Shriji Mahãrãj then began, “The jiva, which resides within the  body, observes both the attractive and the unattractive. It witnesses  childhood, youth and old age, as well as a countless number of other  things. However, the observer fails to observe its own self. The jiva looks at objects externally; but it does not look at its own self.  Therefore, it is the most ignorant of the ignorant.

“Furthermore, just as the jiva indulges in a countless variety of  sights with the eyes, it similarly indulges in and knows the pleasures  of the other vishays with the ears, skin, tongue and nose; but it does  not indulge in the bliss of its own self; nor does it know its own  nature. For this reason, it is the most ignorant of the ignorant, the  most senseless of the senseless, the most foolish of fools and the vilest  of the vile.”

At that point, Shuk Muni raised a doubt. He asked, “Is it truly  in one’s own hands to see one’s own self? If it  is, why does the jiva remain ignorant?”

Shriji Mahãrãj replied, “For a person who has attained satsang,  realisation of his jivãtmã does, indeed, lie in  his own hands. In fact,  when has he attempted to see his own self and failed to see it?  Having become dependent to and made helpless by mãyã, that jiva draws within and enters the dream and deep sleep states, but never  does it draw within of its own accord to see its own self. On the other  hand, one who contemplates on the greatness of God and draws  within oneself sees one’s own self as extremely pure and luminous.  In the midst of that luminance, one beholds the form of the manifest  Purushottam Bhagwãn and experiences bliss in the manner of Nãrad  and the Sanakãdik. Therefore, all deficiencies which do remain in a  devotee are due to his own lethargy.”
