On the night of Mãgshar sudi 6, Samvat 1876 [23 November  1819], Shriji Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in  Gadhadã. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an  assembly of munis as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him.

Thereupon Shriji Mahãrãj said, “Even one who can constantly  see the form of God in his heart should recall the divine actions and  incidents of God performed in His various avatãrs in various places.  He should also maintain affection for the brahmachãris, sãdhus and  satsangis, and should remember them as well. Why? Because if at  the time of death he forgets God’s form, but remembers the divine  actions and incidents performed by Him at various places, or if he  remembers those satsangis, brahmachãris or sãdhus, then by that  association, God’s form will also be remembered. Thereby, that  person attains an elevated spiritual status and benefits tremendously. That is why I perform grand Vishnu-yãgs; annually  celebrate Janmãshtami, Ekãdashi and other observances; and gather  brahmachãris, sãdhus and satsangis on these occasions. After all,  even if a sinner remembers these occasions at the time of his death,  he will also attain the abode of God.”
