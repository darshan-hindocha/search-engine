On Mãgshar sudi 11, Samvat 1876 [27 November 1819], Shriji Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã. Hewas dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an assembly of sãdhus as well as devotees from various places hadgathered before Him.

Thereupon Shriji Mahãrãj said, “If the vruttis of the indriyas are engaged in the service of Shri Krishna Bhagwãn and His Bhakta,  then the antahkaran is purified and the sins that have been attached  to the jiva since time immemorial are destroyed. On the other hand,  if the vruttis of the indriyas are directed towards women and other  vishays, then one’s antahkaran becomes polluted and one falls from  the path of liberation.

“Therefore, one should indulge in the vishays only as prescribed  in the scriptures; but one should never indulge in them by transgressing the regulations that are described in the scriptures.  Also, one should keep association with the Sant and should shun bad  company. In this manner, when a person shuns bad company and  maintains association with the Sant, the sense of I-ness that he  harbours towards his body and the sense of my-ness that he harbours  towards his bodily relations are eradicated. He also develops profound love for God and vairãgya towards everything except God.”
