On the afternoon of Posh sudi 11, Samvat 1876 [27 December  1819], Shriji Mahãrãj was sitting on a large, decorated cot on the  veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in  Gadhadã. He had tied a white pãgh around His head. He was  wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a thick, white  cotton cloth. Two large guldãvadi flowers had been placed upon His  ears, and a tassel of flowers had been inserted in His pãgh. At that  time, while some paramhansas were singing devotional songs to the  accompaniment of a tãl and pakhwãj, other paramhansas as well as  devotees from various places had gathered before Him in an assembly.

Shriji Mahãrãj then said, “Now please stop singing and listen as  I sing a devotional song in the form of a discourse.”

The paramhansas said in return, “Very well, Mahãrãj. Please  do.”

Thereupon Shriji Mahãrãj said, “If, while singing amorous devotional songs, a person is attracted only by God’s form, then that  is fine. But, being attracted to anything except God’s form constitutes a major deficiency. Why? Because just as that devotee  develops affection for and is attracted by sounds related to God, he  also develops affection for and is attracted by worldly songs, musical  instruments, talks related to women, etc. Such a devotee should be  known to lack wisdom. Thus, a person who is attracted to an equal  extent by the words of God and His Sant, and by worldly speech  should forsake such foolishness. Having forsaken such foolishness,  he should experience happiness through sounds and speech related  only to God. Such a person is a genuine amorous devotee.

“Furthermore, just as that devotee wishes for sounds related  only to God, he desires the touch only of God. When he realises other  types of touch to be like touching a black cobra or a blazing fire, then  he is a genuine amorous devotee. Similarly, if a person experiences  profound bliss on seeing God, realising everything else to be like a  pile of filth or a decomposed dog, then he is a genuine amorous  devotee. Similarly, if a person experiences profound bliss on tasting  the prasãd of God, not enjoying the various other types of tastes, then  he is a genuine amorous devotee. Furthermore, such a devotee experiences profound bliss on smelling tulsi, garlands of flowers,  sandalwood paste, the many varieties of fragrant perfumes, etc., that  have been offered to God. He is not pleased on smelling the perfume,  sandalwood paste, or garlands of flowers worn by materialistic people.  In this manner, a person who has intense love for God-related  vishays and an intense aversion for worldly vishays is a genuine amorous devotee.

“On the other hand, a person who becomes an amorous devotee  and yet derives the same pleasure from other types of sights, sounds,  smells, tastes and touch as he does from God-related vishays is a  false amorous devotee. Why? Because he experiences the same type  of joy from vishays as he does from God. Therefore, such amorousness and mode of worship should be forsaken. Why?  Because it is not God who is at fault; it is the amorous devotee’s  attitude that is at fault; i.e., he has believed God to be exactly like  other objects. As a result, his bhakti and amorousness are flawed.

“Now, just as I have described discretion in indulging in the five  types of vishays for the sthul body in the waking state, similarly,  subtle vishays exist for the sukshma body in the dream state. A  devotee may experience happiness from God-related sights, sounds,  smells, tastes and touch on seeing the form of God in his dream, but  if he also derives exactly the same pleasure on seeing other vishays in  his dream, then that devotee’s amorousness is false. If, on the other  hand, a person in his dream experiences happiness only by association with God and feels an aversion for other vishays as if they  were vomited food, then he can be said to be a genuine amorous devotee. If he does not experience this, then although the form of God  seen in his dream is true, that devotee’s understanding is flawed.  Why? Because he has equal love for God and for other vishays.  Thus, true understanding is to remain attracted only towards the  form of God, and not towards other vishays.

“In this way, when only thoughts of God remain while contemplating, a state of void is attained wherein, with the exception  of the form of God, that devotee does not perceive the body or the  brahmãnd at all. Thereafter, while seeing the form of God within  that void, divine light is generated, and the form of God is seen  within that light. So, affection towards only the form of God in this  manner is called faithful bhakti.”

In conclusion, Shriji Mahãrãj added, “When you sing amorous devotional songs, I also close My eyes and think about  just this.  These thoughts of Mine may be simple, but nothing is able to persist  in those thoughts except God. In fact, so powerful are My thoughts  that if any vishay were to come in the way of the amorous love that I  have for God’s form, it would be decapitated. Just as you sing  devotional songs, I have also sung a devotional song in the form of  this discourse, which I have shared with all of you today.”

In this way, using Himself as an example, Shriji Mahãrãj  delivered this discourse for the benefit of His devotees.
