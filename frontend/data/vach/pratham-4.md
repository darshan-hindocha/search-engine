On Mãgshar sudi 7, Samvat 1876 [24 November 1819], Shriji  Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã. He was  dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an assembly of sãdhus as well as devotees from various places had gathered before  Him.

Then Shriji Mahãrãj said, “Devotees of God should not harbour  jealousy amongst themselves.”

Thereupon Ãnandãnand Swãmi said, “But Mahãrãj, even then,  jealousy still remains.”

Hearing this, Shriji Mahãrãj explained, “If one does harbour  jealousy, it should be like that of Nãradji. Once, both Nãradji and  Tumbaru went to Vaikunth for the darshan of Lakshmi and Nãrãyan. There, Tumbaru sang before them. As a result, both  Lakshmi and Nãrãyan were pleased and rewarded him with their  clothes and ornaments. Seeing this, Nãradji became jealous of Tumbaru, and thought, ‘I shall also learn to sing like Tumbaru and  please God.’

“Then, Nãradji learned the art of singing and sang before God.  But God commented, ‘You do not know how to sing like Tumbaru.’  Thereafter, Nãradji performed austerities to please Shiv and received  his blessings to master the art of singing. However, when he sang  before God again, God was still not pleased. In this way, Nãradji  continued for seven manvantars. Despite this, God would not be  pleased with his singing.

“Finally, Nãradji learned to sing from Tumbaru himself and then sang before Shri Krishna Bhagwãn in Dwãrikã. Only then was  Shri Krishna Bhagwãn pleased, and only then did he reward Nãradji  with his own clothes and ornaments. Thereafter, Nãradji abandoned  his jealousy towards Tumbaru.

“Thus, if one is to harbour jealousy, one should imbibe the virtues of the person towards whom one is jealous, and should also  abandon one’s own faults. If this cannot be done, then a devotee of  God should at least totally abandon any form of jealousy that would  result in harming another devotee of God.”
