On Posh vadi 1, Samvat 1876 [1 January 1820], Shriji Mahãrãj  was sitting on a large, decorated cot on the veranda outside the room  facing north, in line with the mandir of Shri Vãsudevnãrãyan in  Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white cotton cloth. He had also tied  a white feto around His head. Around His neck were garlands of white flowers, and tassels of white flowers were dangling from both of  His ears. He was also wearing a string of white flowers around His  wrists. At that time, while some munis were singing devotional  songs, other munis as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him in an assembly.

Shriji Mahãrãj then requested, “Please begin a question-answer  dialogue.”

Thereupon Dinãnãth Bhatt asked, “Mahãrãj, at times, thousands of thoughtsi arise, yet they do not leave a lasting impression in the mind. At other times, however, only an insignificant thought arises, yet it leaves a strong impression on the  mind. What is the reason for this? Also, by what means can a  devotee eradicate such disturbing thoughts?”
