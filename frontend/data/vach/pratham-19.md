On the evening of Posh sudi 1, Samvat 1876 [17 December  1819], Shriji Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in  Gadhadã. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an  assembly of paramhansas as well as devotees from various places had  gathered before Him.

Thereupon Shriji Mahãrãj said, “In this Satsang fellowship, those devotees seeking their own ultimate liberation cannot fulfill  that aim by ãtmã-realisation alone; nor can they fulfill that aim by  lovingly offering the nine types of bhakti alone; nor can they fulfill  that aim by vairãgya alone; nor can they fulfill that aim by swadharma alone. Thus, all four virtues, i.e., ãtmã-realisation,  bhakti, vairãgya and swadharma. should be perfected since all are  dependent upon each other.

“Now please listen as I describe how these four virtues are interdependent.

“One may have the virtue of ãtmã-realisation, but if one does not  have lovei towards God, then one does not attain the favour of God,  which can only be attained by such love. Such favour results in the  attainment of the desirable and great divine power of not being  overpowered by the gunas of mãyã. If, on the other hand, one does  have love for God, but has not attained ãtmã-realisation, then due to  the belief that oneself is the body, that love cannot be perfected. One  may have both the virtue of ãtmã-realisation and love for God, but if  one lacks firm vairãgya, then the desires for worldly vishays will  prevent the perfection of ãtmã-realisation and love for God. Then  again, one may have vairãgya, but if one lacks the virtues of ãtmã realisation and love for God, one does not experience the profound  bliss associated with the form of God. Also, one may have swadharma, but if love for God, ãtmã-realisation and vairãgya are  absent, then one will not be able to transcend Bhurlok, Bhuvarlok  and all of the other realms up to Brahmã’s Satyalok. That is to say,  one will not be able to transcend the brahmãnds and attain God’s  Akshardhãm, which transcends the darkness of mãyã. On the other  hand, one may have the three virtues of ãtmã-realisation, love for  God and vairãgya, but if swadharma is lacking, the other three cannot be perfected.

“In this manner, ãtmã-realisation and the other three virtues  are dependent upon each other. A devotee who has extremely firmly  established these four virtues within himself through the profound  association with God’s Ekãntik Bhakta has completed all spiritual  endeavours. Only he should be known as an ekãntik bhakta.  Therefore, a devotee having any deficiency in these four virtues should overcome that deficiency by serving and profoundly associating with the Ekãntik Bhakta of God.”
