On Mãgshar vadi 5, Samvat 1876 [6 December 1819], Shriji Mahãrãj was sitting in a west-facing room of Dãdã Khãchar’sdarbãr in Gadhadã. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white cotton cloth. He had also tied awhite pãgh around His  head, and a tassel of yellow flowers was inserted into that pãgh. Wearing a garland of yellow flowers, Mahãrãj wasseated in this manner in a very cheerful mood while a passage from the Shrimad Bhãgwat was being read.

At that time, Shriji Mahãrãj called for Muktãnand Swãmi,  Gopãlãnand Swãmi and some other sãdhus. Addressing them, He  said, “In our Satsang fellowship, a small element of negative influence remains, which I wish to eliminate today. I want to conduct this matter in such a manner that it encompasses all satsangis, paramhansas, sãnkhya-yogis and karma-yogis.

“Now, what is this negative influence in Satsang? Well, those  who preach in Satsang speak discouragingly. That is the negative  influence in Satsang. What do they say? They say, ‘Who can follow  God’s commands thoroughly? Who can possibly observe the religious  vows perfectly? No one. Therefore, we should observe only as much  as we possibly can. After all, God is the redeemer of even the wicked,  and so He will grant liberation to us as well.’

“Moreover, they say, ‘Attempting to behold God’s form in the  heart is not possible by one’s own efforts. It is only beheld by those  whom God helps out of compassion.’ With such complacent words,  they discourage others from practising dharma, gnãn, vairãgya,  bhakti, and other spiritual endeavours for pleasing God.

“Therefore, from this day onwards, no one in our Satsang fellowship should utter such discouraging words. Instead, always  speak courageously. Those who do speak such words should be known as impotents. In fact, on days when one speaks such discouraging words, one should observe a fast.”
