On Mãgshar sudi 12, Samvat 1876 [28 November 1819], Shriji Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã. Hewas dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an assembly of munis as well as devotees from various places hadgathered before Him.

Thereupon Shriji Mahãrãj said, “Suppose a person has developed a conviction of the manifest form of Shri KrishnaBhagwãn, offers bhakti to Him and does His darshan. But, despite this, he still does not consider himself fulfilled, andinstead, feels a deficiency within  his antahkaran; that is, ‘As long as I have not seen the radiant form of this very same God in Golok, Vaikunth and theother abodes, I have not attained ultimate liberation.’ Even talks about God should not be heard from a person with suchignorance.

“Conversely, if a person has firm faith in the manifest form of  God and believes himself to be fulfilled merely by His darshan, and  desires nothing else, then God Himself forcefully shows him His  divine powers and forms in His abodes.

“Therefore, one with singular faith in God should desire nothing  except the manifest form of God.”
