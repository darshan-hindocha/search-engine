            "On the night of M\u00e3gshar sudi 4, Samvat 1876 [21 November  1819], Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j had come to the residential hall of the s\u00e3dhus in D\u00e3d\u00e3 Kh\u00e3char\u2019s darb\u00e3r in Gadhad\u00e3. He was dressed entirely in  white clothes. At that time, an assembly of s\u00e3dhus as well as  devotees from various places had gathered before Him.",
            "Thereupon Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j asked, \u201cWhich is the most difficult of  all spiritual endeavours?\u201d",
            "The brahmach\u00e3ris, s\u00e3dhus and householders answered according to their own understanding, but none could give a satisfactory reply.",
            "Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j then said, \u201cAllow Me to answer. There is no  spiritual endeavour more difficult than to continuously engage one\u2019s  mind on the form of God. The scriptures state that there is no greater attainment for a person whose mind\u2019s vrutti is constantly  focused on the form of God, because the form of God is like a chint\u00e3mani. Just as a person who possesses a chint\u00e3mani attains  whatever he desires, a person whose mind\u2019s vrutti is constantly  focused on the form of God can instantly see, if he so wishes, the  forms of jiva, ishwar, m\u00e3y\u00e3 and Brahma. He can also see Vaikunth,  Golok, Brahmamahol and the other abodes of God. Therefore, there  is no spiritual endeavour more difficult nor is there any greater  attainment than to continuously engage one\u2019s mind on the form of  God.\u201d",
            "Thereafter, the devotee Govardhanbh\u00e3i Sheth asked Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j, \u201cWhat is the nature of God\u2019s m\u00e3y\u00e3?\u201d",
            "Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j replied, \u201cM\u00e3y\u00e3 is anything that obstructs a devotee of God while meditating on God\u2019s form.\u201d",
            "Then Mukt\u00e3nand Sw\u00e3mi inquired, \u201cWhat type of body does a  devotee of God attain when he leaves his physical body, which is  composed of the five bhuts, and goes to the abode of God?\u201d",
            "Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j answered, \u201cA devotee who has sought refuge in  Dharmakul will attain, by the wish of God, a divine body composed of  Brahma. When such devotees leave their body and go to the abode of  God, some go by sitting on Garud, some go by sitting on a chariot and  some go by sitting on a celestial vehicle. This is how they reach the  abode of God. Those who have mastered yogic sam\u00e3dhi can actually  witness these events.\u201d",
            "Thereafter, the devotee Harji Thakkar asked Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j,  \u201cSome have been practising satsang for quite some time,yet they do  not harbour the same profound love for the Satsang fellowship as  they do for their own body and relatives. What is the reason for  this?\u201d",
            "Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j explained, \u201cSuch a person has not fully realised  the greatness of God. Consequently, when the Sant \u2013 by whose  association God\u2019s greatness is fully realised \u2013 talks to him about his  swabh\u00e3vs, the person is not able to overcome them. Instead, he bears  an aversion towards the Sant. It is due to this sin that he does not  develop intense love for the Satsang fellowship. After all, sins committed elsewhere are washed away through association with the  Sant, but sins committed against the Sant are washed away only by  the grace of the Sant himself, not by any other means. The scriptures also state: Anya-kshetre krutam p\u00e3pam teertha-kshetre vinashyati | Teertha-kshetre krutam p\u00e3pam vajra-lepo bhavishyati || Sins committed elsewhere are destroyed at a place of pilgrimage; [but] sins  committed at a place of pilgrimage are as if etched in iron [i.e. totally irredeemable].  Skand Pur\u00e3nTherefore, if one does not bear an aversion towards the Sant, one  develops profound love for the Satsang fellowship.\u201d"

But, like King Janak, he  is not affected by those activities. He may indulge in the most  alluring of the panchvishays \u2013 sights, sounds, smells, tastes and touch \u2013 attained as a consequence of his own pr\u00e3rabdha, but he does  so dejectedly and with total indifference towards them. Those vishays are unable to entice him; thus, his renunciation remains  undiminished. He invariably views those vishays as flawed and treats them like enemies. Moreover, he constantly remains in contact with s\u00e3dhus and the sacred scriptures, and remains in the  service of God.

Such a person is said to possess an  intermediate level of vair\u00e3gya.",
            "\u201cAs for a person who has the lowest level of vair\u00e3gya, if he were  to encounter ordinary or inferior vishays,he may indulge in them,  but he would not become bound by them.

He should also maintain affection for the brahmach\u00e3ris, s\u00e3dhus and  satsangis, and should remember them as well. Why? Because if at  the time of death he forgets God\u2019s form, but remembers the divine  actions and incidents performed by Him at various places, or if he  remembers those satsangis, brahmach\u00e3ris or s\u00e3dhus, then by that  association, God\u2019s form will also be remembered. Thereby, that  person attains an elevated spiritual status and benefits tremendously. That is why I perform grand Vishnu-y\u00e3gs; annually  celebrate Janm\u00e3shtami, Ek\u00e3dashi and other observances; and gather  brahmach\u00e3ris, s\u00e3dhus and satsangis on these occasions.

            "Hearing this, Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j explained, \u201cIf one does harbour  jealousy, it should be like that of N\u00e3radji. Once, both N\u00e3radji and  Tumbaru went to Vaikunth for the darshan of Lakshmi and N\u00e3r\u00e3yan. There, Tumbaru sang before them. As a result, both  Lakshmi and N\u00e3r\u00e3yan were pleased and rewarded him with their  clothes and ornaments.

But God commented, \u2018You do not know how to sing like Tumbaru.\u2019  Thereafter, N\u00e3radji performed austerities to please Shiv and received  his blessings to master the art of singing. However, when he sang  before God again, God was still not pleased. In this way, N\u00e3radji  continued for seven manvantars. Despite this, God would not be  pleased with his singing.",
            "\u201cFinally, N\u00e3radji learned to sing from Tumbaru himself and then sang before Shri Krishna Bhagw\u00e3n in Dw\u00e3rik\u00e3. Only then was  Shri Krishna Bhagw\u00e3n pleased, and only then did he reward N\u00e3radji  with his own clothes and ornaments. Thereafter, N\u00e3radji abandoned  his jealousy towards Tumbaru.",
            "\u201cThus, if one is to harbour jealousy, one should imbibe the virtues of the person towards whom one is jealous, and should also  abandon one\u2019s own faults. If this cannot be done, then a devotee of  God should at least totally abandon any form of jealousy that would  result in harming another devotee of God.\u201d"

What are those Pradh\u00e3n-Purush pairs like? Well, they are the cause  of the creation of countless millions of brahm\u00e3nds.

            "\u201cFirstly, Purushottam Shri Krishna Bhagw\u00e3n, in the form of  Purush, impregnated the womb of Pradh\u00e3n. From that Pradh\u00e3n,  mahattattva evolved. From mahattattva, the three types of ahamk\u00e3r evolved. Of these, from s\u00e3ttvik-ahamk\u00e3r, the man and the presiding  deities of the indriyas evolved; from r\u00e3jas-ahamk\u00e3r, the ten indriyas,  the buddhi and the pr\u00e3ns evolved; and from t\u00e3mas-ahamk\u00e3r, the five  bhuts and the five tanm\u00e3tr\u00e3s evolved. In this way, all of those elements were produced.",
            "\u201cThen, inspired by God\u2019s will, each element, with its own constituents, helped create the bodies of the ishwars and the jivas. A  particular ishwar\u2019s bodies are known as vir\u00e3t, sutr\u00e3tm\u00e3 and avy\u00e3krut; and a particular jiva\u2019s bodies are known as sthul, sukshma and k\u00e3ran.",
            "\u201cThe body of the ishwar called Vir\u00e3t has a lifespan of two par\u00e3rdhs. Fourteen manvantars elapse during one of Vir\u00e3t-Purush\u2019s  days. His night is of the same duration as the day. During his day,  the lower ten realms of the brahm\u00e3nd remain in existence, and after  his night falls, they are destroyed. This is called nimitta-pralay.  When the two par\u00e3rdhs of Vir\u00e3t-Purush have elapsed, the body of  Vir\u00e3t is destroyed along with Satyalok and the other realms. At that  time, Pradh\u00e3n-Prakruti, Purush, and the 24 elements2 including mahattattva are absorbed back into mah\u00e3m\u00e3y\u00e3. This is called pr\u00e3krut-pralay. When that mah\u00e3m\u00e3y\u00e3 is absorbed by the divine  light of Aksharbrahma \u2013 like the night merges into the day \u2013 it is  called \u00e3tyantik-pralay. Also, the day-to-day death of the bodies of  individual deities, demons, humans and others is called nitya-pralay.",
            "\u201cIn this manner, by knowing the process of the creation, sustenance and dissolution of the various realms, one develops  vair\u00e3gya towards the world and bhakti towards God. In addition,  when all of those brahm\u00e3nds are destroyed, all other jivas lie dormant within m\u00e3y\u00e3, whereas the devotees of God attain the abode  of God.\u201d",
            "Again, Mukt\u00e3nand Sw\u00e3mi inquired, \u201cWhat is the abode of God  like?\u201d",
            "Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j replied, \u201cThe abode of God is without a beginning  and without an end; it is divine, infinite and indivisible; and it is  characterised by eternal existence, consciousness and bliss. I shall  describe it using an analogy. Imagine that this whole world, with all  of its mountains, trees, humans, animals and all other forms, is  made of glass. Also imagine that all of the stars in the sky are as  bright as the sun. Then, just as this glass world would glow with  extreme beauty amidst this radiance, the abode of God is similarly  beautiful. Devotees of God see this in sam\u00e3dhi and attain that  luminous abode after death.\u201d"

He had tied a golden shelu around His head, and another golden shelu wastied around His waist. Pearl necklaces hung around His neck, and tassels of pearls were also dangling from His p\u00e3gh. Atthat time, an assembly of munis as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him.",
            "Thereupon Nity\u00e3nand Sw\u00e3mi asked Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j, \u201cIs there only one jiva within each body, or are there many? If Yousay there is only one, then when the branches of banyan, pipal or other trees are cut and planted elsewhere, exactly thesame type of tree grows there as well. Has that one jiva been dissected into two, or has another jiva entered the newtree? If You say that it is the same jiva, then how has the jiva, which is whole and indivisible, been cut?\u201d",
            "Hearing this, Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j said, \u201cHere, I shall answer the question. Purush and Prakruti are the instruments of  Shri Krishna  Bhagw\u00e3n. He is the cause of the creation, sustenance, and dissolution of this cosmos. Through His two instruments of Purush  and Prakruti, He assumed the form of Vir\u00e3t. Then, during the first  Br\u00e3hma-kalp, from his body in the form of Vir\u00e3t, God gave all beings  from Brahm\u00e3 to the smallest blade of grass their respective bodies.  Thereafter, during the P\u00e3dma-kalp, God, through the form of Brahm\u00e3, gave Marichi and others their respective bodies. Then  through Kashyap and Daksha, He gave the deities, demons, humans,  animals, and all of the mobile and immobile life forms their bodies.  That Shri Krishna Bhagw\u00e3n, along with His instruments in the form of Purush and Prakruti, resides as the antary\u00e3mi in all jivas and grants each jiva a body according to its past karmas.",
            "\u201cThat jiva, in its past lives, has performed many karmas \u2013 some  with sattvagun predominating, some with rajogun predominating  and some with tamogun predominating. As a consequence of those  karmas, God grants that jiva a body of the udbhij category, or a body  of the jar\u00e3yuj category, or a body of the svedaj category, or a body of  the andaj category. God also grants it the fruits of its karmas in the  form of happiness and misery.",
            "In addition, God makes the body of that jiva give birth to another body \u2013 again, according to its own karmas. Just as God  created the various life forms from the bodies of Kashyap and the  other praj\u00e3patis, similarly, that same God, while residing in all jivas as antary\u00e3mi, creates other bodies from one body by methods appropriate to that particular body. However, the jiva, through  which other bodies are created, does not itself multiply into many  forms. So, in reality, God grants birth to a jiva, through an  appropriate body of another jiva, according to the relation of the karmas between the two jivas.\u201d"

He had tied  a white p\u00e3gh around His head. He was also wearing a white khes  and had covered Himself with a white cotton cloth. Also, tassels of  yellow flowers decorated His p\u00e3gh. Bunches of yellow flowers had  been placed above both of His ears, with roses decorating those bunches. Garlands of yellow flowers adorned His neck as well. With  His right hand, He was playing with a white sevanti flower. At that  time, an assembly of munis as well as devotees from various places  had gathered before Him.",
            "Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j then asked the munis, \u201cSuppose there are two  devotees of God. One has renounced worldly life, and although he  does not have intense vair\u00e3gya, he does physically observe the religious vows thoroughly. Nevertheless, he still harbours a slight  desire for worldly life in his mind, but he overcomes this by a thought  process. He also has firm faith in God. Such is the renunciant. On  the other hand, there is another devotee, a householder, who also has  firm faith in God. Even though he has remained a householder by  God\u2019s command, he is disinterested in worldly life. He has the same  intensity of worldly desires as the renunciant. Of these two devotees  of God, who is better?\u201d",
            "Mukt\u00e3nand Sw\u00e3mi replied, \u201cThe renunciant devotee is better.\u201d",
            "Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j countered, \u201cThe renunciant has renounced of his  own accord, out of frustration; so how can he be better? The  householder, on the other hand, has stayed at home because of God\u2019s  command; so how can he be inferior?\u201d",
            "Mukt\u00e3nand Sw\u00e3mi attempted to answer Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j\u2019s  question in many ways but was unable to do so satisfactorily. Thus,  he said, \u201cMah\u00e3r\u00e3j, please answer the question Yourself.\u201d",
            "Thereupon Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j said, \u201cIf a renunciant who is weak minded receives rich foods to eat, then desires for worldly life will be  revived within his heart. Or, if he encounters many hardships,  again, desires for worldly life will be revived. Compared to such a  renunciant, a householder is much better, because whenever a householder encounters times of extreme hardship or even times of  great pleasure, he is always cautious lest he becomes attached to these pleasures. With this awareness, he remains disinterested in  worldly life. Therefore, a true renunciant is one who has no desires  for worldly life having once renounced it.",
            "\u201cKeep in mind, though, that a householder is much better than a  renunciant with worldly desires, provided he observes the dharma prescribed for householders. The householders\u2019 dharma, however, is  extremely difficult to observe, because countless occasions of good and  bad times are encountered. Despite this, a true householder\u2019s mind  does not waver from serving the Sant or from observing his dharma.  He also realises, \u2018The profound association of the Sant that I have  attained is like a magnificent chint\u00e3mani and a kalpavruksh. My  wealth, property, sons and daughters are all merely like a dream,  whereas the profound association of the Sant that I have attained is  the only true benefit of life.\u2019 Moreover, he remains undeterred amidst  any type of adversity that may come his way. Such a householder is  by far the better of the two. Therefore, of all things, becoming a  devotee of God is very difficult. Moreover, to attain the association of  the Bhakta of God is very rare, indeed.\u201d",
            "Having spoken in this way, Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j then arranged for  the singing of devotional songs written by Mukt\u00e3nand Sw\u00e3mi  describing the glory of God and His Sant.",
            "Thereafter Mukt\u00e3nand Sw\u00e3mi asked, \u201cThe Shrutis state, \u2018\u2022\u00e3\u00c3\uf8ff  \u00ff\u00ca \u25ca\u00c1\u00c3\u2014 \u201a\u00ca \u00aa\u00c1\u00c3\u2014\u2013\u2019i. They claim that if one\u2019s mind is  fixed on God at  the time of death, one will attain a favourable fate after death; otherwise, one will not. This seems to be the interpretation of that  Vedic verse. If this is so, what is the significance of the bhakti one  has performed throughout one\u2019s life?\u201d",
            "Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j explained, \u201cA person who has been graced with  the attainment of the manifest form of God never falls from the path  of liberation, regardless of whether he remembers God at the time of  death. God invariably protects him.",
            "\u201cConversely, a person who has turned away from God does not  attain liberation even if he dies normally, while being conscious.  Instead, he is consigned to Yampuri after death. Many sinful butchers die while still fully conscious. But if a devotee of God suffers  an untimely death, does that mean he will not attain liberation?  Moreover, will that sinner attain liberation? Certainly not.  Therefore, that Vedic verse should be interpreted as follows: \u2018The outcome at the time of death is determined by the present state of the  mind.\u2019 Thus, a devotee who realises in his mind, \u2018My liberation is  guaranteed,\u2019 will, as a result, certainly attain liberation after death.  In comparison, a person who has not been graced with the attainment of the Sant or the form of God will feel in his mind, \u2018I am  ignorant, and I will not attain liberation.\u2019 As a result, his state of  mind will determine his fate after death.",
            "\u201cFurthermore, a person who is a servant of God has nothing left  to do. In fact, other jivas attain liberation by his darshan, so what is one\u2019s jiva after one\u2019s death. Hiranyakeshiyash\u00e3kh\u00e3 Shruti surprising about he himself attaining liberation? But to cultivate servitude towards God is very difficult indeed. Why? Because a servant of God has the following characteristics: He realises the physical body is asatya, and his own \u00e3tm\u00e3 is satya. He harbours no desires to indulge in the objects that are intended for his Master.  Also, he never behaves contrary to the wishes of his Master. Such a person is called a true servant of God; whereas a servant of God who behaves as the body is a pseudo-devotee.\u201d"

Even if this process takes 10 years, 20 years,  25 years, or even 100 years, he still does not become discouraged; and  never does he abandon his attempts at beholding God\u2019s form. After  all, Shri Krishna Bhagw\u00e3n has mentioned in the Git\u00e3:Therefore, one who continues to behold God in this manner is called  an ek\u00e3ntik bhakta.\u201d"

He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white cotton cloth. He had also tied awhite p\u00e3gh around His  head, and a tassel of yellow flowers was inserted into that p\u00e3gh. Wearing a garland of yellow flowers, Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j wasseated in this manner in a very cheerful mood while a passage from the Shrimad Bh\u00e3gwat was being read.",
            "At that time, Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j called for Mukt\u00e3nand Sw\u00e3mi,  Gop\u00e3l\u00e3nand Sw\u00e3mi and some other s\u00e3dhus. Addressing them, He  said, \u201cIn our Satsang fellowship, a small element of negative influence remains, which I wish to eliminate today. I want to conduct this matter in such a manner that it encompasses all satsangis, paramhansas, s\u00e3nkhya-yogis and karma-yogis.",
            "\u201cNow, what is this negative influence in Satsang? Well, those  who preach in Satsang speak discouragingly. That is the negative  influence in Satsang. What do they say? They say, \u2018Who can follow  God\u2019s commands thoroughly? Who can possibly observe the religious  vows perfectly? No one. Therefore, we should observe only as much  as we possibly can. After all, God is the redeemer of even the wicked,  and so He will grant liberation to us as well.\u2019",

It is only beheld by those  whom God helps out of compassion.\u2019 With such complacent words,  they discourage others from practising dharma, gn\u00e3n, vair\u00e3gya,  bhakti, and other spiritual endeavours for pleasing God.",

            "Three hours before sunrise on M\u00e3gshar vadi 6, Samvat 1876 [7  December 1819], Sw\u00e3mi Shri Sahaj\u00e3nandji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j was sitting on a  large, decorated cot in the courtyard in front of the veranda outside  the west-facing rooms of D\u00e3d\u00e3 Kh\u00e3char\u2019s darb\u00e3r in Gadhad\u00e3. He  was dressed entirely in white clothes.",
            "After summoning the paramhansas and satsangis, Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j sat engrossed in thought for quite some time. Then He said, \u201cI wish to tell all of you something, so please listen.\u201d He then said, \u201cIn My mind I feel that I should not talk about this matter, but  understanding all of you to be Mine, I shall tell you anyway. The  matter is such that only one who understands it and acts exactly  according to it will become a mukta. Otherwise, even by listening to,  or studying and understanding the meanings of the four Vedas, six  Sh\u00e3stras, eighteen Pur\u00e3ns, and the Mah\u00e3bh\u00e3rat and other Itih\u00e3s  scriptures, one cannot become a mukta. I shall now talk about that  matter, so please listen.",
            "\u201cRegardless of the tempting objects which may appear before Me,  if there is no desire for them in My mind, I am not worried. Besides,  My nature is such that even if the slightest desire for an object arises  within, I feel at ease only after shunning it.",
            "\u201cFor this reason, I thought about what actually causes disturbances within the hearts of God\u2019s devotees. I considered the  man, buddhi, chitt and ahamk\u00e3r as possible causes. However, the  antahkaran is not the cause of these disturbances. The only fault of  the antahkaran is the complacency that it harbours \u2013 due to either  the power of its faith in God or the strength derived from knowledge  of the \u00e3tm\u00e3. Due to this complacency, it feels, \u2018I have found God, and  so I have nothing left to do.\u2019",
            "\u201cActually, the greater fault lies with the five gn\u00e3n-indriyas,  which I shall now elaborate in detail. Of the many varieties of foods  that a person eats, each has differing tastes and differing intrinsic  qualities. When he eats that food, the intrinsic qualities of the food pervade and affect the antahkaran as well as the entire body. For  example, if someone drinks bhang, then even if he is a devotee of God,  he loses awareness of his religious vows and the worship of God due  to the stimulation caused by that bhang. Similarly, the intrinsic  qualities of the countless types of food are, like bhang, of a countless  variety. So much so, that they seem endless.",
            "\u201cIn the same way, a person also hears a countless variety of  sounds with his ears. Those sounds also have a countless variety of  intrinsic qualities. Consequently, the qualities of whatever sounds he  listens to pervade and affect his antahkaran. For example, there  may be an armed and violent person, an adulterous person, a prostitute, or a person who transgresses the rules of the Vedas and  society. Listening to the talks of such vicious persons is like drinking bhang or alcohol; i.e., such talks pollute the antahkaran of  the listener and make him forget the worship of God as well as his  religious vows.",
            "\u201cSimilarly, there are countless varieties of touch sensations.  They too have countless varieties of intrinsic qualities. The touch of  a sinful person also has an effect like that of bhang and alcohol.  Therefore, even if a devotee were to touch such a person, that devotee  would lose all of his virtues.",
            "\u201cThere are also countless varieties of things to see. They too  have countless varieties of intrinsic qualities. If one looks at an  immoral person, the effect is just as detrimental as drinking bhang or alcohol, i.e., looking at an immoral person certainly does pollute  one\u2019s mind and cause harm.",
            "\u201cIn the same way, there are countless varieties of smells, with  countless varieties of intrinsic qualities. If  one smells the fragrance  of a flower or some sandalwood paste from the hands of a sinful  person, it pollutes one\u2019s mind in the same way as drinking bhang.",
            "\u201cConversely, just as one\u2019s mind is polluted by association with  the immoral, association with God or His Sant  purifies one\u2019s mind.  Even if one\u2019s mind is polluted, it is purified by listening to the words  of God and His Sant. The mind is similarly purified by their touch.  If, however, due to the constraints of one\u2019s religious vows, one is  unable to touch such a great Sant, then merely touching the dust of  his feet to one\u2019s head makes one pure. Likewise, one is purified by  the darshan of the great Sant; but of course one should do darshan while respecting one\u2019s religious vows. One is also purified by eating  his pras\u00e3d. Here also, pras\u00e3d should be taken in accordance with  the niyams of one\u2019s caste and \u00e3shram as set by God. If one is unable  to take pras\u00e3d, one should offer s\u00e3kar and take that as pras\u00e3d. In  the same manner, smelling the fragrance of the flowers and sandalwood paste offered to the great Sant also purifies the mind.",
            "\u201cOn the other hand, if one indulges in the panchvishays thoughtlessly, without distinguishing good from bad, then even if one  is as great as N\u00e3rad and the Sanak\u00e3dik, one\u2019s mind will surely  become polluted. What is so surprising, then, about the mind of one  who believes oneself to be the body becoming polluted? Therefore, if  one gives liberty to the five indriyas without applying the discrimination of what is suitable or unsuitable, one\u2019s antahkaran will become polluted. On the other hand, if one indulges only in pure  vishays through the five indriyas, then one\u2019s antahkaran becomes  pure. If the antahkaran becomes pure, one will be able to constantly  remember God.",
            "\u201cHowever, if the objects of indulgence of just one of the five indriyas is impure, the antahkaran will also become impure.  Therefore, the sole cause of any disturbance experienced by a devotee  of God during worship is the vishays of the five indriyas, not the  antahkaran.",
            "\u201cAnother factor that determines the nature of a person\u2019s  antahkaran is the type of company he keeps. If he sits in a gathering  of materialistic people in a lavish seven-storey haveli decorated with  beautiful mirrors and comfortable seats, and if those materialistic  people are seated wearing various types of jewellery and fine clothes,  and are exchanging alcohol amongst themselves, with prostitutes  performing vulgar dances to the accompaniment of various musical  instruments \u2013 then the person\u2019s antahkaran will unquestionably be  adversely affected. On the other hand, if a person sits in an assembly  where a paramhansa is seated on a torn mattress in a grass hut and  discourses of God, dharma, gn\u00e3n, vair\u00e3gya and bhakti are in progress \u2013 then the person\u2019s antahkaran will surely be favourably  affected.",
            "\u201cTherefore, if one thoughtfully examines the influence of good  company and evil company on the antahkaran, their effects can be  realised. A fool, however, cannot realise this. Indeed, this fact will  not be understood by those who behave irresponsibly like animals. In  comparison, one who has even a little wisdom and has sought at least  some refuge in God will immediately understand. Therefore, all  paramhansas, s\u00e3nkhya-yogis and karma-yogis should not associate  with evil people.",
            "\u201cRegardless of how evil a person may be before joining the Satsang fellowship, he should be accepted into Satsang after he takes  the appropriate vows. If after joining Satsang, however, that person  retains his evil nature, he should be removed from Satsang. If he or  she is not removed, then much harm will result. For example, if a  person\u2019s finger is bitten by a snake, or if it develops gangrene, and if  the affected part is immediately removed, then the rest of the body  remains healthy. But if it is not removed, much harm results.  Similarly, if a person is recognised as evil, you should immediately  shun him.",
            "\u201cIn conclusion, be wise enough to accept these words of Mine. If  you do so, I shall consider it to be equivalent to you having served Me  in every way. I will also bless all of you and be extremely pleased  with you. Why? Because thereby you will have justified My efforts.  Moreover, all of us will dwell together in the abode of God. However,  if you do not behave in this manner, we will be greatly distanced.  Consequently, you will be reborn as a ghost or a demon, and you will  have to suffer. Of course, the fruits of whatever bhakti you may have  previously offered to God will be rewarded eventually, but only after  much misery. Even then, you will become a mukta and go to the  abode of God only by behaving as I have described.",
            "\u201cFurthermore, if anyone attempts to imitate Me, he will definitely suffer. Why? Because Narn\u00e3r\u00e3yan resides within My  heart. Moreover, I am eternally liberated. I have not become a mukta through the preaching of others. I exercise complete control  over My man, buddhi, chitt and ahamk\u00e3r. In fact, I seize My  antahkaran just as a lion clutches a goat, whereas others cannot  even see their antahkaran. Therefore, imitating Me, believing that  one can remain pure even amidst alluring pleasures is just not  possible, even for the likes of N\u00e3rad and the Sanak\u00e3dik. So what can  be said of others?",
            "\u201cCountless have become muktas and countless more will become  so. Amongst them, none have been able to indulge in pleasures of the  senses and yet remain uninfluenced by them; none will be able to do  so in the future; nor is there anyone like that presently. Even one  who has endeavoured for countless millions of years is incapable of  remaining uninfluenced amidst temptations. Therefore, if you behave as I have described, you will benefit.\u201d",
            "Continuing, Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j said, \u201cWhen I lovingly call someone  near, it is for the benefit of their jiva. When I look at someone affectionately, or eat the tasty meals they have prepared, or sit on a  decorated cot arranged by them, or accept from them clothes, ornaments, garlands of flowers and other offerings \u2013 it is all for the  good of their jiva, but not for the sake of My personal enjoyment. In  fact, I swear by the name of R\u00e3m\u00e3nand Sw\u00e3mi that I do not accept  those objects for My personal pleasure. Therefore, realising this,  none of you should imitate Me.  \u201cAlso, keep the activities of your five indriyas extremely pure. Please  accept this command of Mine without fail. This fact is simple in that  it is comprehensible to all; so all of you will immediately understand  it. Moreover, if you extensively propagate it throughout Satsang, I  shall be very pleased indeed.\u201d",
            "Having delivered this discourse, Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j bid \u2018Jai Sachchid\u00e3nand\u2019 to all and returned to His residence."

Thus, all four virtues, i.e., \u00e3tm\u00e3-realisation,  bhakti, vair\u00e3gya and swadharma. should be perfected since all are  dependent upon each other.",

            "\u201cOne may have the virtue of \u00e3tm\u00e3-realisation, but if one does not  have lovei towards God, then one does not attain the favour of God,  which can only be attained by such love. Such favour results in the  attainment of the desirable and great divine power of not being  overpowered by the gunas of m\u00e3y\u00e3. If, on the other hand, one does  have love for God, but has not attained \u00e3tm\u00e3-realisation, then due to  the belief that oneself is the body, that love cannot be perfected. One  may have both the virtue of \u00e3tm\u00e3-realisation and love for God, but if  one lacks firm vair\u00e3gya, then the desires for worldly vishays will  prevent the perfection of \u00e3tm\u00e3-realisation and love for God. Then  again, one may have vair\u00e3gya, but if one lacks the virtues of \u00e3tm\u00e3 realisation and love for God, one does not experience the profound  bliss associated with the form of God. Also, one may have swadharma, but if love for God, \u00e3tm\u00e3-realisation and vair\u00e3gya are  absent, then one will not be able to transcend Bhurlok, Bhuvarlok  and all of the other realms up to Brahm\u00e3\u2019s Satyalok. That is to say,  one will not be able to transcend the brahm\u00e3nds and attain God\u2019s  Akshardh\u00e3m, which transcends the darkness of m\u00e3y\u00e3. On the other  hand, one may have the three virtues of \u00e3tm\u00e3-realisation, love for  God and vair\u00e3gya, but if swadharma is lacking, the other three cannot be perfected.",
            "\u201cIn this manner, \u00e3tm\u00e3-realisation and the other three virtues  are dependent upon each other. A devotee who has extremely firmly  established these four virtues within himself through the profound  association with God\u2019s Ek\u00e3ntik Bhakta has completed all spiritual  endeavours. Only he should be known as an ek\u00e3ntik bhakta.  Therefore, a devotee having any deficiency in these four virtues should overcome that deficiency by serving and profoundly associating with the Ek\u00e3ntik Bhakta of God.\u201d"

            "Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j then began, \u201cThe jiva, which resides within the  body, observes both the attractive and the unattractive. It witnesses  childhood, youth and old age, as well as a countless number of other  things. However, the observer fails to observe its own self. The jiva looks at objects externally; but it does not look at its own self.  Therefore, it is the most ignorant of the ignorant.",
            "\u201cFurthermore, just as the jiva indulges in a countless variety of  sights with the eyes, it similarly indulges in and knows the pleasures  of the other vishays with the ears, skin, tongue and nose; but it does  not indulge in the bliss of its own self; nor does it know its own  nature. For this reason, it is the most ignorant of the ignorant, the  most senseless of the senseless, the most foolish of fools and the vilest  of the vile.\u201d",

In fact,  when has he attempted to see his own self and failed to see it?  Having become dependent to and made helpless by m\u00e3y\u00e3, that jiva draws within and enters the dream and deep sleep states, but never  does it draw within of its own accord to see its own self. On the other  hand, one who contemplates on the greatness of God and draws  within oneself sees one\u2019s own self as extremely pure and luminous.  In the midst of that luminance, one beholds the form of the manifest  Purushottam Bhagw\u00e3n and experiences bliss in the manner of N\u00e3rad  and the Sanak\u00e3dik.

            "Thereafter, He began, \u201cA devotee who in his mind desires to intensely please God can do so by the following means: unshakeable  resolve in observing the dharma of one\u2019s caste and \u00e3shram; intensely  firm \u00e3tm\u00e3-realisation; dislike for all objects except God; and bhakti which is devoid of all desires for fruits, and which is accompanied  with an understanding of God\u2019s greatness. It is through these four  spiritual endeavours that God can be extremely pleased. They are  collectively known as ek\u00e3ntik dharma. At present, there are many  devotees possessing such ek\u00e3ntik dharma in our Satsang fellowship.",
            "\u201cIn addition, a devotee of God should contemplate on the form of  God while eating, drinking, bathing, washing, walking and sitting \u2013 in fact, during all activities. He should particularly contemplate on  God and continuously behold His form when there is no mental  disturbance within. However, when there is some internal disturbance due to fluctuating thoughts, he should realise his own  self to be distinct from the body, the indriyas, the antahkaran, their  presiding deities and the vishays. Only when those disturbing thoughts subside should he contemplate on the form of God.",
            "\u201cFurthermore, this body should not be believed to be one\u2019s true  self. Nor should one\u2019s bodily relations be regarded as one\u2019s true relations. This is because the jiva has previously taken birth in each  of the 8.4 million life forms3. In fact, the jiva has taken birth in the  wombs of all females in this world; it has also taken birth numerous  times in the wombs of all of the dogs, cats, monkeys and other types  of life forms in the cycle of 8.4 million life forms. Moreover, of all the  different types of females in this world, which has it not previously  made its wife? All have been its wife at one time or another.  Similarly, assuming numerous female bodies, that jiva has also made  all of the different forms of males its husband. Hence, just as one  does not believe the relations of those previous 8.4 million life forms  to be one\u2019s true relations, and just as one does not believe the bodies  of those 8.4 million life forms to be one\u2019s true body, similarly, one  should not believe this present body to be one\u2019s true self, nor should  one believe the relations of this body to be one\u2019s true relations. Why?  Because just as no relationship remains with bodies from the previous 8.4 million life forms, similarly the relationship with this  body will not remain either. Therefore, having realised the body, all  possessions and all objects to be asatya; and having realised one\u2019s  own self to be distinct from the body, indriyas and antahkaran; and  while observing one\u2019s own dharma, one should offer bhakti to God  which is devoid of all desires for its fruits. Moreover, in order to  increasingly understand the profound greatness of God day by day,  one should also constantly keep the company of a s\u00e3dhu.",
            "\u201cA person who does not have this understanding, who identifies  his self with the body, and who has a mundane attitude should be  thought of as an animal \u2013 even if he is presently in the Satsang  fellowship. Yet, in this Satsang, even animals attain liberation by  the profound grace of God. What is so surprising, then, about humans attaining liberation? However, such a person cannot be called a true ek\u00e3ntik bhakta of God. Only one possessing the understanding previously described can be called an ek\u00e3ntik bhakta.  After such an ek\u00e3ntik bhakta leaves his body and becomes free of all  influences of m\u00e3y\u00e3, he attains Akshardh\u00e3m via the archim\u00e3rg.\u201d",
            "Continuing, Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j explained, \u201cThat Akshar has two forms. One, which is formless and pure chaitanya, is known as  Chid\u00e3k\u00e3sh or Brahmamahol. In its other form, that Akshar remains  in the service of Purushottam N\u00e3r\u00e3yan. A devotee who has reached  Akshardh\u00e3m attains qualities similar to those of Akshar and forever  remains in the service of God. Furthermore, Shri Krishna Purushottam N\u00e3r\u00e3yan is forever seated in that Akshardh\u00e3m. The  countless millions of muktas, who have attained qualities similar to  those of Akshar, reside in that Akshardh\u00e3m, and all of them behave  as servants of Purushottam. Purushottam N\u00e3r\u00e3yan Himself is the  master of them all and the Lord of the lords of countless millions of  brahm\u00e3nds.",
            "\u201cKeeping this in mind, all of our satsangis should develop the  following singular conviction: \u2018We also wish to join the ranks of the  aksharrup muktas and go to Akshardh\u00e3m to forever remain in the  service of God. We have no desire for the temporary and vain worldly  pleasures; nor do we wish to be tempted by them in any way.\u2019 Keeping such a firm conviction, one should offer ek\u00e3ntik bhakti to  God.",
            "\u201cFurthermore, by thoroughly understanding the profound greatness of God, one should, in this very life, eradicate  one\u2019s desires  for women, wealth and all objects other than God. Otherwise, if  desires for objects other than God do remain, then after one dies, if  one encounters enticements along the path to the abode of God, one  will forsake God and be lured by those enticements instead. This  would prove to be a major obstruction. Therefore, one should worship  God after overcoming desires for all objects.\u201d"

He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A tassel of flowers had been inserted in His p\u00e3gh, and bunches of flowers had  been placed upon both of His ears. He was also wearing a garland of  guld\u00e3vadi flowers around His neck. At that time, while some paramhansas were singing devotional songs, other paramhansas as  well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him in an  assembly.",

Besides, there are many people in this world who sing and play  instruments without remembering God; but they do not attain peace  of mind. Therefore, whichever activity one performs \u2013 whether it be  singing devotional songs, reciting God\u2019s holy name, chanting the \u2018N\u00e3r\u00e3yan\u2019 dhunya, etc. \u2013 one should only perform that activity while  remembering the form of God.",

Therefore, one should practise maintaining one\u2019s vrutti on the  form of God while walking, eating, drinking \u2013 in fact, during all    activities. If one does this, one\u2019s vrutti becomes steadied on God  when one engages in worship as well. Moreover, when one\u2019s vrutti begins to remain on God, it remains so even during other work. If  one is complacent, though, one\u2019s vrutti will not remain on God even  when one specifically attempts to engage oneself in worship.

At that time, paramhansas as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him.",
            "Out of compassion, Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j then began to speak to the  paramhansas, \u201cThe V\u00e3sudev M\u00e3h\u00e3tmya scripture is extremely dear  to Me because it describes all of the methods of how devotees of God  should worship Him.\u201d",
            "Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j then continued, \u201cThere are two types of devotees of God: One has a complete conviction of God, yet worships God identifying himself with the body. The other, however, believes his  own self to be chaitanya, transcending the influences of the three  states \u2013 waking, dream and deep sleep, and the three bodies \u2013 sthul,  sukshma and k\u00e3ran. This devotee worships God while beholding  God\u2019s form within his own self. As a result, he sees his own self,  which transcends the three states and the three bodies, as being  extremely full of divine light. Within that light, he sees the form of  God, just as it is in its incarnate form, as being extremely luminous.  Such is the elevated spiritual state of the latter devotee.",
            "\u201cAs long as one has not attained this elevated spiritual state, one  is subject to obstacles, even if one is a devotee of God. Shivji, for  example, did not behave in such an elevated spiritual state and was  therefore enticed by the beauty of Mohini. Brahm\u00e3 also did not  behave in such a state and thus became infatuated on seeing Saraswati. N\u00e3radji also did not behave in such an elevated spiritual  state and consequently harboured a desire to marry. Moreover, because Indra, Chandra and others were not behaving in such a state, their reputations were also blemished due to their mistakes.",
            "\u201cFurthermore, if a person has not developed this elevated spiritual state, he will perceive worldly attributes even in God, even if  he himself is a devotee of God. King Parikshit, for example, was not  such a devotee, and so he raised doubts about the divinity of Shri  Krishna Bhagw\u00e3n after hearing of the r\u00e3s episode. On the other  hand, because Shukji was such an elevated devotee, he had no doubts  whatsoever. Such a devotee firmly realises, \u2018If no flaws can affect me  or bind me in any way, how can there possibly be any m\u00e3yik flaws in  God, by whose worship I have become like this?\u2019 Such a devotee  firmly realises this.",
            "\u201cWhen such a devotee of God focuses his vrutti on the form of  God, that vrutti is divided into two. Of these, one vrutti focuses on  the form of God, while the other focuses within the worshipper himself. The vrutti that is fixed on God\u2019s form is applied lovingly,  whereas the vrutti that is fixed on the worshipper himself is full of  contemplation. This latter vrutti negates all other thoughts and desires \u2013 except those of worshipping God \u2013 that may arise in the  worshipper. It also negates all of the flaws within the worshipper  himself. In this manner, the vrutti of such a devotee constantly  remains on God.",
            "\u201cA person who at times worships God with a concentrated mind  and, at other times, indulges in worldly thoughts does not develop  such an elevated spiritual state. Consider, for example, a pot that is  filled with water and emptied somewhere. If another pot of water is  subsequently emptied at the same place on the following day or the  day after that, a pool of water will not collect there. Why? Because  the water poured on the first day dries up on that very day, and the  water poured on the second day also dries up on that same day. On  the other hand, if a trickle of water were to flow continuously, a large  pool of water would soon be formed. Therefore, while eating, drinking, walking, engaging in any activity whatsoever \u2013 whether it  be pure or impure \u2013 in fact, at all times, one should constantly keep  one\u2019s vrutti on God. While maintaining one\u2019s vrutti constantly on  God in this manner, one attains that abiding elevated spiritual state.\u201d"

At that time,  paramhansas as well as devotees from various places had gathered  before Him.",
            "Thereupon Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j said to the paramhansas, \u201cI shall  explain how an elevated spiritual state can be attained by gn\u00e3n.  What is that gn\u00e3n like? Well, it transcends Prakruti-Purush. When  an elevated spiritual state is attained by this gn\u00e3n, Prakruti-Purush  and the entities evolved from them do not come into view. This is  known as gn\u00e3n-pralay. One who has attained such an elevated spiritual state sees only pure chaitanya \u2013 within which only the form  of God resides, with no other forms remaining. At times, one cannot  see even the form of God within that divine light; only the light is  seen. At other times, however, both the divine light and the form of  God are seen. This is known as the elevated spiritual state attained  by gn\u00e3n. Such an elevated spiritual state is attained by constantly  maintaining one\u2019s vrutti on the form of the incarnate God visible at  present.\u201d",
            "Continuing, Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j said, \u201cThe extent to which one has  understood the greatness of God determines the intensity of both the  divine light experienced in the heart and the divine sound of pranav that is heard. Furthermore, the extent of one\u2019s faith and understanding of the greatness of God determines the extent to which  vicious thoughts are curbed. Thus, when one develops absolute faith  in God and thoroughly understands His greatness, all of one\u2019s vicious  thoughts are eliminated.",
            "\u201cFor example, if a person has sucked a slice of lemon, his teeth  become a little sensitive, but he is still able to chew soft chan\u00e3.  However, if he has sucked a whole lemon, he is unable to chew even  chan\u00e3; in fact, he chews even a mung bean with much difficulty. If,  however, he has sucked many lemons, he would be unable to chew even cooked rice. In the same manner, when one has developed \u2018sourness\u2019 in the form of faith in God and an understanding of His  greatness, one\u2019s gums \u2013 in the form of the four antahkarans and ten  indriyas \u2013 become sensitised. In that state, the jiva is unable to  chew chan\u00e3 in the form of thoughts for the vishays with its gums in  the form of the man. With its gums in the form of the chitt, the jiva becomes incapable of contemplating on the vishays. With its gums in  the form of the buddhi, the jiva becomes incapable of developing a  resolve for the vishays. With its gums in the form of the ahamk\u00e3r, the jiva becomes incapable of developing any form of consciousness  related to the vishays. Similarly, the jiva, with its gums in the form  of the five gn\u00e3n-indriyas and five karma-indriyas, becomes incapable  of chewing chan\u00e3 in the form of the vishays of the respective indriyas.",
            "\u201cConversely, the indriyas and the antahkaran of a person who  does not have absolute faith in God and who has not fully realised the greatness of God do not withdraw completely from their respective  vishays.\u201d",
            "Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j then explained, \u201cThe form of God transcends  m\u00e3y\u00e3 and its gunas, and is free of all types of flaws, but it is for the  sake of the liberation of jivas that He appears to be like a human. In  fact, God is devoid of each of the flaws that senseless people attribute  to Him. However, the intellect of the person attributing such flaws  will never be freed of those flaws that he attributes to God.  Specifically, a person who believes God to be full of lust will himself  become intensely full of lust; a person who believes God to be full of  anger will himself become intensely full of anger; a person who believes God to be full of avarice will himself become intensely full of  avarice; and a person who believes God to be full of jealousy will  himself become intensely full of jealousy; etc. In fact, whatever types  of flaws a person attributes to God will ultimately cause misery to the  person himself \u2013 just as a fistful of sand thrown at the sun falls back  into the thrower\u2019s eyes. On the other hand, if a person realises God  to be absolutely flawless, then regardless of his own swabh\u00e3vs, he  himself becomes absolutely flawless as well.\u201d",
            "Thereafter, Brahm\u00e3nand Sw\u00e3mi asked, \u201cSuppose there is a person whose indriyas are not drawn towards any of the vishays; nor  do vicious thoughts arise in his antahkaran. He also has absolute  faith in God. Despite this, though, a feeling of unfulfillment remains,  and he feels despondent within. What can be the reason for this?\u201d",
            "Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j replied, \u201cThat is also a major deficiency in the  devotee; i.e., despite the fact that his mind has become stable and  despite the fact that he has intensely firm faith in God, he still fails  to experience profound happiness in his heart. Specifically, he does  not feel, \u2018I am extremely fortunate and completely fulfilled, whereas  others in the world are constantly being troubled by lust, anger,  avarice, infatuation, arrogance, matsar, desires and cravings. They  are subject to the three types of sufferingsi day and night. As for me,  the incarnate form of Purushottam has compassionately revealed His  own form to me. He has also freed me from lust, anger and all of the  other vicious natures. He has also placed me in the company of s\u00e3dhus similar to N\u00e3rad and the Sanak\u00e3dik. Indeed, I am very  fortunate.\u2019 Failing to think in this manner, and failing to remain  extremely elated throughout the day is a major deficiency. In fact,  such a devotee is like a child who has been given a chint\u00e3mani in its  hand, yet derives no happiness from it because it does not realise the  chint\u00e3mani\u2019s value. Similarly, the major drawback of that devotee is  that despite having attained Purushottam Bhagw\u00e3n, he does not feel  constant elation within by realising, \u2018I am completely fulfilled.\u2019",
            "\u201cMoreover, when a fault is noticed in a devotee, one should think, \u2018His swabh\u00e3v is such that it is not suitable in  the Satsang  fellowship; nevertheless, he has attained satsang. Regardless of what  he is like, he has still remained in the Satsang fellowship. Surely,  then, his sansk\u00e3rs from past lives or from this very life must be  extremely favourable for him to have attained this satsang.\u2019 With  or animals), adhy\u00e3tma (those caused by one\u2019s own mind)this understanding, one should highly appreciate even such a person\u2019s virtues.\u201d",

            "On the morning of Posh sudi 7, Samvat 1876 [23 December  1819], Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j arrived at the residence of the paramhansas in  D\u00e3d\u00e3 Kh\u00e3char\u2019s darb\u00e3r in Gadhad\u00e3. He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a thick, white cotton cloth. He had  also tied a white feto around His head. He was sitting facing east on  the western veranda. At that time, paramhansas as well as devotees  from various places had gathered before Him.",
            "Thereupon Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j said out of compassion, \u201cA devotee of  God who observes only swadharma does not feel completely fulfilled  within his heart. That feeling of fulfillment can only be attained by  \u00e3tm\u00e3-realisation and the knowledge of God\u2019s greatness. Moreover,  the extent of the deficiency in these two attributes determines the  extent of the deficiency in his experience of fulfillment. Therefore, a  devotee of God should firmly cultivate these two qualities.",
            "\u201cMoreover, the extent of the deficiency remaining in these two  factors also determines the extent of the hindrances experienced  during sam\u00e3dhi. Recently, I granted sam\u00e3dhi to a devotee in which  she saw intense divine light. Seeing that light, she began to scream;  she shouted, \u2018I\u2019m burning!\u2019 Therefore, even those who experience  sam\u00e3dhi require \u00e3tm\u00e3-realisation. If one does not realise one\u2019s own  self to be the \u00e3tm\u00e3 and instead believes one\u2019s self to be the body,  much deficiency will remain. I explained to that devotee, \u2018Your self is  the \u00e3tm\u00e3, not the body. You are not this L\u00e3dkib\u00e3i of the Bh\u00e3t sub caste. Rather, your self is the \u00e3tm\u00e3, which is unpierceable and uncuttable.\u2019 I then placed her into sam\u00e3dhi again and told her, \u2018Go  to the four-petalled lotus at the site of Ganapati and behold your own  self there.\u2019",
            "\u201cWhen a person in sam\u00e3dhi enters the site of Ganapati, that  person hears divine sounds and sees divine light. When he enters the  higher site of Brahm\u00e3, he hears louder sounds and sees brighter  light. When he enters the still higher site of Vishnu, he hears even  louder sounds and sees even brighter light. In this manner, as he  enters higher and higher locations, he hears increasingly louder sounds and sees increasingly brighter light. As a result of the intense divine light seen in sam\u00e3dhi, and the loud thunderous sounds  that occur, even the most resolute become timid. For example,  despite being a devotee of God and despite being extremely brave,  Arjun was still incapable of beholding God\u2019s Vishwarup form. He  therefore pleaded, \u2018O Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j! I am incapable of beholding this form of yours. Please grant me darshan of your former form.\u2019 Similarly,  in sam\u00e3dhi, when thundering noises like those of an entire brahm\u00e3nd exploding are heard, and masses of intense light like overflowing oceans are seen, even the brave lose their patience.  Therefore, one should understand one\u2019s own self to be distinct from  the body.",
            "\u201cSam\u00e3dhi experienced in this manner is achieved in two ways.  One is controlling the pr\u00e3ns through pr\u00e3n\u00e3y\u00e3m, whereby the chitt is  also controlled. The other is by controlling the chitt, whereby the  pr\u00e3ns are also controlled. When is control over the chitt achieved? It  is achieved when one\u2019s vruttis are detached from everything else and  focused only on God. However, these vruttis can be focused on God  only when desires for everything else are overcome and only a singular desire for the form of God remains. Thereafter, those vruttis will not be deflected from God\u2019s form by any means whatsoever. For example, if twenty pails of water are drawn from a  well, and the flow of water from each pail allowed to flow in separate  directions, then there would be little force in each flow. However, if  the flow of all twenty pails of water are combined, then the resultant  flow would become extremely powerful \u2013 like that of a river \u2013 and  would not be able to be diverted by any means whatsoever.  Similarly, when a person\u2019s vruttis have become free of worldly desires, his chitt focuses only on God\u2019s form.",
            "\u201cConversely, when a person has desires in his chitt for the pleasures of the world, his vrutti is widely dispersed among countless  types of sounds via the ears. Similarly, via the skin, the vrutti is  dispersed among thousands of different types of touch sensations; the  vrutti of the eyes is dispersed among thousands of different types of  things to see; the vrutti of the tongue is dispersed among thousands  of different types of tastes; and the vrutti of the nose is dispersed  among countless types of smells. In the same manner, the vruttis of  his karma-indriyas are dispersed among their respective vishays in thousands of different ways. In this way, via the ten indriyas, his  antahkaran is dispersed in thousands of different ways. Only when  his chitt contemplates on God, and his man generates thoughts of  God, and his buddhi establishes the conviction of God, and his  ahamk\u00e3r harbours the consciousness, \u2018I am the \u00e3tm\u00e3, and a devotee  of God,\u2019 can his desire for God be known to have become singular.",
            "\u201cAlternatively, the control of the chitt by controlling the pr\u00e3ns is  achieved by asht\u00e3ng-yoga, which comprises of eight stages: yam, niyam, \u00e3san, pr\u00e3n\u00e3y\u00e3m, praty\u00e3h\u00e3r, dhy\u00e3n, dh\u00e3rn\u00e3 and sam\u00e3dhi.  This asht\u00e3ng-yoga is a means, and its fruit is the nirvikalp sam\u00e3dhi of God. When this nirvikalp sam\u00e3dhi is achieved, the chitt is  controlled by controlling the pr\u00e3ns. On the other hand, if the chitt focuses on God after becoming free of worldly desires, then the pr\u00e3ns are controlled by control of the chitt. Therefore, just as the chitt is  controlled by mastering asht\u00e3ng-yoga, similarly, the chitt can also be  controlled by focusing on the form of God. A devotee whose chitt\u2019s  vrutti becomes focused on the form of God masters asht\u00e3ng-yoga without even attempting to master it. Therefore, the spiritual endeavours of \u00e3tm\u00e3-realisation and the knowledge of God\u2019s greatness  that I have just described should be firmly practised.",
            "\u201cFurthermore, one\u2019s religious vows \u2013 which are God\u2019s injunctions \u2013 should certainly be observed. For example, the dharma of a Br\u00e3hmin is to bathe, lead a pure life and never drink even water  from a Shudra\u2019s house. Similarly, a satsangi should never falter in  observing God\u2019s injunctions. Why? Because God will be pleased with  him if he behaves accordingly.",
            "\u201cMoreover, a person should very firmly maintain both the knowledge of God\u2019s greatness as well as the knowledge of  the \u00e3tm\u00e3 coupled with vair\u00e3gya. He should also feel fulfilled by realising, \u2018Now  I have no deficiencies remaining.\u2019 With this understanding, he should constantly offer bhakti to God. Having said this though, he  should not get carried away in the elation of this understanding. Nor  should he feel unfulfilled. If he does feel unfulfilled, then the blessings that have been showered upon him by God can be considered as not having germinated \u2013 like a seed sown in saline soil.  Conversely, if he gets carried away and begins to behave waywardly,  then that is like having thrown a seed into a fire, which burns it.  Therefore, if one understands as I have explained, then no form of  deficiency will remain whatsoever.\u201d"

            "On the afternoon of Posh sudi 11, Samvat 1876 [27 December  1819], Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j was sitting on a large, decorated cot on the  veranda outside the east-facing rooms of D\u00e3d\u00e3 Kh\u00e3char\u2019s darb\u00e3r in  Gadhad\u00e3. He had tied a white p\u00e3gh around His head. He was  wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a thick, white  cotton cloth. Two large guld\u00e3vadi flowers had been placed upon His  ears, and a tassel of flowers had been inserted in His p\u00e3gh. At that  time, while some paramhansas were singing devotional songs to the  accompaniment of a t\u00e3l and pakhw\u00e3j, other paramhansas as well as  devotees from various places had gathered before Him in an assembly.",
            "Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j then said, \u201cNow please stop singing and listen as  I sing a devotional song in the form of a discourse.\u201d",
            "The paramhansas said in return, \u201cVery well, Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j. Please  do.\u201d",
            "Thereupon Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j said, \u201cIf, while singing amorous devotional songs, a person is attracted only by God\u2019s form, then that  is fine. But, being attracted to anything except God\u2019s form constitutes a major deficiency. Why? Because just as that devotee  develops affection for and is attracted by sounds related to God, he  also develops affection for and is attracted by worldly songs, musical  instruments, talks related to women, etc. Such a devotee should be  known to lack wisdom. Thus, a person who is attracted to an equal  extent by the words of God and His Sant, and by worldly speech  should forsake such foolishness. Having forsaken such foolishness,  he should experience happiness through sounds and speech related  only to God. Such a person is a genuine amorous devotee.",
            "\u201cFurthermore, just as that devotee wishes for sounds related  only to God, he desires the touch only of God. When he realises other  types of touch to be like touching a black cobra or a blazing fire, then  he is a genuine amorous devotee. Similarly, if a person experiences  profound bliss on seeing God, realising everything else to be like a  pile of filth or a decomposed dog, then he is a genuine amorous  devotee. Similarly, if a person experiences profound bliss on tasting  the pras\u00e3d of God, not enjoying the various other types of tastes, then  he is a genuine amorous devotee. Furthermore, such a devotee experiences profound bliss on smelling tulsi, garlands of flowers,  sandalwood paste, the many varieties of fragrant perfumes, etc., that  have been offered to God. He is not pleased on smelling the perfume,  sandalwood paste, or garlands of flowers worn by materialistic people.  In this manner, a person who has intense love for God-related  vishays and an intense aversion for worldly vishays is a genuine amorous devotee.",
            "\u201cOn the other hand, a person who becomes an amorous devotee  and yet derives the same pleasure from other types of sights, sounds,  smells, tastes and touch as he does from God-related vishays is a  false amorous devotee. Why? Because he experiences the same type  of joy from vishays as he does from God. Therefore, such amorousness and mode of worship should be forsaken. Why?  Because it is not God who is at fault; it is the amorous devotee\u2019s  attitude that is at fault; i.e., he has believed God to be exactly like  other objects. As a result, his bhakti and amorousness are flawed.",
            "\u201cNow, just as I have described discretion in indulging in the five  types of vishays for the sthul body in the waking state, similarly,  subtle vishays exist for the sukshma body in the dream state. A  devotee may experience happiness from God-related sights, sounds,  smells, tastes and touch on seeing the form of God in his dream, but  if he also derives exactly the same pleasure on seeing other vishays in  his dream, then that devotee\u2019s amorousness is false. If, on the other  hand, a person in his dream experiences happiness only by association with God and feels an aversion for other vishays as if they  were vomited food, then he can be said to be a genuine amorous devotee. If he does not experience this, then although the form of God  seen in his dream is true, that devotee\u2019s understanding is flawed.  Why? Because he has equal love for God and for other vishays.  Thus, true understanding is to remain attracted only towards the  form of God, and not towards other vishays.",
            "\u201cIn this way, when only thoughts of God remain while contemplating, a state of void is attained wherein, with the exception  of the form of God, that devotee does not perceive the body or the  brahm\u00e3nd at all. Thereafter, while seeing the form of God within  that void, divine light is generated, and the form of God is seen  within that light. So, affection towards only the form of God in this  manner is called faithful bhakti.\u201d",
            "In conclusion, Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j added, \u201cWhen you sing amorous devotional songs, I also close My eyes and think about  just this.  These thoughts of Mine may be simple, but nothing is able to persist  in those thoughts except God. In fact, so powerful are My thoughts  that if any vishay were to come in the way of the amorous love that I  have for God\u2019s form, it would be decapitated. Just as you sing  devotional songs, I have also sung a devotional song in the form of  this discourse, which I have shared with all of you today.\u201d",
            "In this way, using Himself as an example, Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j  delivered this discourse for the benefit of His devotees."

            "Before sunrise on Posh sudi 12, Samvat 1876 [28 December  1819], Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j arrived at the residential hall of theparamhansas in D\u00e3d\u00e3 Kh\u00e3char\u2019s darb\u00e3r in Gadhad\u00e3. There, He sat on a platform facing west. He had tied a white fetoaround His head.  He had also covered Himself with a thick, white cotton cloth and was wearing a khes. At that time, an assembly ofparamhansas had gathered before Him.",
            "After a few minutes of contemplation, Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j said,  \u201cEveryone wishes to worship God, but their understanding differs.  But God fully resides in the heart of a person who possesses the following understanding: \u2018The earth remains stable and trembles; the  stars remain steady in the sky; the rains fall; the sun rises and sets;  the moon appears and disappears, waxes and wanes; the vast oceans  remain constrained within their boundaries; a drop of liquid develops  into a human possessing hands, feet, a nose, ears and the rest of the  ten indriyas; the clouds, through which lightning strikes, float unsupported in the sky \u2013 these and a countless variety of other  wonders are due only to the form of God that I have attained.\u2019 With  this understanding, he has the conviction that no one except the incarnate form of God is the cause of these wonders. He realises,  \u2018The countless wonders which have occurred in the past, those which  are currently taking place, and those which will occur in the future  are all only due to the manifest form of God that I have attained.\u2019",
            "\u201cMoreover, he also has the following understanding: \u2018Even if someone were to throw dust on me, or were to humiliate me in any  way, or were to seat me on a donkey after cutting off my nose and  ears; or even if someone were to honour me by seating me on an  elephant \u2013 all these situations would be equal for me.\u2019 Such a devotee  views a beautiful young woman, an unattractive woman and an old  woman with equality; he treats a heap of gold and a pile of stones  with equality; he also possesses countless noble virtues such as gn\u00e3n,  bhakti, vair\u00e3gya, etc. God eternally resides in the heart of such a  devotee.",
            "\u201cConsequently, by the grace of God, that devotee attains countless types of powers and liberates countless beings. Despite these powers, though, he tolerates the praises and insults of other  people. This itself is also a great feat, because to tolerate despite  being so powerful is not easy for others to achieve. Therefore, one  who tolerates in this manner should be considered to be extremely  great.",
            "\u201cThe powers of such a person are such that since it is God who  sees through his eyes, he empowers the eyes of all of the beings in the  brahm\u00e3nd; and since it is God who walks through his legs, he is also  capable of endowing the strength to walk to the legs of all of the  beings in the brahm\u00e3nd. Thus, since it is God who resides in all of  the indriyas of such a Sant, that Sant is able to empower the indriyas of all beings in the brahm\u00e3nd. Therefore, such a Sant is  the sustainer of the world. His greatness lies in the fact that he  tolerates the insults delivered even by insignificant people. Only those who are forgiving in this manner should be considered to be  extremely great.",
            "\u201cOn the other hand, those who threaten and frighten those meeker than themselves and believe, \u2018I have become great,\u2019 are not  truly great. In fact, those people in this world who frighten others by  showing yogic powers should not be considered to be devotees of God;  rather, they are beings lost in m\u00e3y\u00e3 and suitable only for Yampuri.  Their greatness is limited to the worldly realm. For example, in  society, a person with one horse is considered to be greater than  someone with no horses at all; whereas a person with five horses is  considered to be greater than someone with only one horse. In this  way, the wealthier a person is, the greater he is considered to be in  society. However, such a person is not great in the spiritual realm.\u201d",
            "Continuing, Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j said, \u201cHouseholders and renunciants  who believe, \u2018This woman is very beautiful; these clothes are extremely fashionable; this house is very nice; this gourd is very nice  and this utensil is very nice\u2019 are all petty-minded. Then you may ask  whether such people will attain liberation or not. Well, in this  Satsang fellowship, even the wretched attain liberation. However,  the former persons never develop the virtues of a s\u00e3dhu, or the noble  virtues of the Sant previously described. Why? Because they have  not become suitable for such nobility.\u201d",
            "After delivering this discourse, Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j bid \u2018Jai Sachchid\u00e3nand\u2019 to all and returned to His residence in D\u00e3d\u00e3 Kh\u00e3char\u2019s darb\u00e3r."

He was dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, the s\u00e3dhus had sat down to eat in His  presence.",
            "Thereupon Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j said, \u201cWhen a satsangi is likely to  regress in the Satsang fellowship, vicious desires steadily flourish  within him. At first, he begins to perceive flaws in all of the satsangis day by day. In his heart, he feels, \u2018All of these satsangis lack understanding; only I have true understanding.\u2019 In this way, he  considers himself to be superior to all. Such a person remains constantly uneasy, day and night. He cannot sit peacefully anywhere  during the day; nor can he sleep at night. Moreover, his anger never  subsides. In fact, he constantly smoulders like a half-burnt log. A  person who behaves in this manner should be known to be on the  verge of falling out of Satsang. No matter how many days he spends  in Satsang, he will never experience peace in his heart; ultimately,  he will fall from Satsang.",
            "\u201cConversely, when a person is likely to progress in Satsang, pure  desires steadily flourish within him. Day by day, he sees only virtues  in all of the satsangis. He views all devotees as superior to himself  and considers himself to be insignificant. Moreover, he experiences  the bliss of Satsang in his heart 24 hours a day. Such characteristics  indicate that pure desires have flourished. In fact, the more such a  person practises satsang, the more he benefits; and eventually, he  attains profound greatness.\u201d",

            "Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j then said, \u201cPlease ask a question.\u201d",
            "Thereupon Gop\u00e3l\u00e3nand Sw\u00e3mi asked, \u201cHow can the force of bhakti coupled with dharma, gn\u00e3n and vair\u00e3gya be intensified?\u201d",
            "Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j replied, \u201cThere are four means to accomplish  this: One is a pure place, the second is an auspicious time, the third  is pious actions, and the fourth is the company of a holy person1. Of  these, the influence of actions is slight, whereas the influences of  place, time and company are more powerful. Why? Because, if a  place is pure, and the time is pure and one also keeps the company of  a s\u00e3dhu like yourself, then actions will naturally be pure as well.  Conversely, if a place is impure \u2013 like the region of Sindh, if the time  is impure, and if one also keeps the company of prostitutes and perverted people, or of those who consume alcohol and meat, then  actions will certainly be impure as well. Therefore, one should stay  where there is a pure place and should abandon \u2013 by whatever means  necessary \u2013 a place where the time has become unfavourable. One  should keep the company of devotees of God as well as the company of  the Sant who is a knower of Brahma and who observes the five religious vows4. As a result, a devotee\u2019s bhakti for God gains tremendous vigour. This is the answer to your question.\u201d",
            "Thereafter Mukt\u00e3nand Sw\u00e3mi asked, \u201cMah\u00e3r\u00e3j, initially a devotee may be very impure at heart, but he later becomes extremely  pure. Is this due to his previous sansk\u00e3rs, the grace of God or the  devotee\u2019s personal endeavours?\u201d",
            "Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j explained, \u201cThe good or bad that occurs due to  one\u2019s previous sansk\u00e3rs is apparent to everyone in the world. For  instance, the case of Bharatji becoming attached to a deer can be  understood to be due to pr\u00e3rabdha. Or if a poor person were to  receive a large kingdom, then everyone would come to know of it.  That should be known as pr\u00e3rabdha.\u201d",
            "Then, narrating His own story, Shriji Mah\u00e3r\u00e3j continued, \u201cNow,  considering the spiritual endeavours I had performed, it is inconceivable that My body should survive such austerities, yet even  in those circumstances it did survive. That can be considered to be  due to pr\u00e3rabdha. What were those circumstances? Well, while  staying in Purushottampuri, I spent many months surviving merely  on air. On one occasion, I allowed My body to be carried away by a  river that was three to four g\u00e3us wide. During the winter, summer  and monsoon, I stayed without any shelter whatsoever, wearing only  a loincloth. I also used to wander in the jungle amongst wild animals  such as tigers, elephants and wild buffaloes. I travelled in countless  such arduous conditions, yet My body did not perish. In these situations, one should consider pr\u00e3rabdha to be responsible.",

In these situations, as well as when one\u2019s mind is purified by the wish of God,  or by His grace, or by the grace of His Ek\u00e3ntik Sant who has been  pleased by one\u2019s extremely pure sentiments \u2013 the influence of God\u2019s  grace should be considered to be responsible.",
